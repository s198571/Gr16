"That's only supposition. No one knows exactly how many and what types of ships he has under his control. All that we do know is that his flagship is a customized Providence class carrier, optimized for space combat," replied the Commodore.
"Just one of the most dangerous of its class," grumbled the captain.
"Captain Nimzicky, I suggest that you stow such talk," said Commander Hess heatedly. "We have received our marching orders from Admiral Rod!"
"Commodore, I suggest that Commander Hess leave these proceedings. She obviously doesn't know her place," said Captain Nimzicky, which produced a flurry of nods from a couple of other captains, namely Captains Belloc and Roche, in command of the Nebulon B frigates Fearless and Rapture respectfully.
The Commodore's face was impassive, but Kayla could tell from his strong emotions that he was very close to throwing these three captains off his ship. She directed her senses to the four Nebulon B captains, and noticed that the youngest, Captain Farrow Castillo, was the most open minded, while sharing some of the feelings of attraction to her as the other three, he was also the one who was most like a gentlemen, and didn't like the tone of Captain Nimzicky, something to tell the Commodore in private.
"She is my executive officer and has my complete trust, Captain Nimzicky. Her bluntness is actually an asset to me, as it saves me from having to be rude to you. Now I suggest that unless you have something constructive to add, you will stay silent and listen to the plan."
Captain Nimzicky was enough of a professional to remain silent in his chair and show no emotions upon his face, but everyone could tell he wasn't happy.
"Now that that's taken care of you will all listen to the plan..."
