		"I can guarantee that Doctor Thorne will keep her confidentiality oath. All she will confirm is that you came to her, but she will never reveal what you tell her. Believe me, she would die first before breaking a confidence," he said reassuringly.

		Commander Hess became pensive, but as she thought about how she just reacted...
		</p>
		<p>
		"Very well, I'll consider it, but for now I need to meet the battle group's new captains and bring them to the conference room."
		</p>
		<p>
		"Very well Mirialia. By the way, we're here," he said as they walked into the main hangar, which had its space doors open and the atmospheric shields engaged, ready to receive the shuttles.

		<p>
		As Ganto split off from her she said sheepishly, "Sorry about the arm."
		</p>
		<p>
		"No worries, it wasn't broken, and it's not the first time someone almost broke it," he said reassuringly.
		</p>
		<p>
		She nodded gratefully, then stood in the safe zone, and waited for the shuttles to arrive.

		Minutes later the conference room was packed with the captains of the nineteen ships of the Challenger battle group. Most of the occupants were male, with only three exceptions. Three of the younger captains, all from the newer Nebulon Bs, were casting 'interested' glances at Kayla, which she subtlety pointed out to the Commodore, and he gave all three of them pointed glares, which instantly stopped them. The last Nebulon B commander, an older man, cast an interested glance as well and followed up with a question. "What is the twi'lek's purpose here?"

		<p>
		"She is my servant, and currently is serving in the role of assistant," Commodore Hawks answered imperiously. "You will do well to forget her presence in this meeting."
		</p>
		<p>
		Everyone of the newcomers got a chill down their spine from the tone he used, which promised a very horrible end for anyone disobeying his orders.
		</p>
		<p>
		"You all know our general orders, but now we're going to get into specifics. We are going to be hunting down this man," the Commodore stated as Kayla worked a pad in her hands and a holographic image of Arulo Csalas appeared over the conference table. "He is wanted for piracy, mass murder, and an assortment of war crimes. So far the slippery bastard has slipped past every trap the navy has attempted, but we are the ones are going to catch him!"
		</p>
		<p>
		"And how are we going to do that, sir?" the same older captain asked with a sneer. "From what I've read the nineteen ships we have are not going to be enough. He has forty two ships, most of them being no smaller frigate size, and he has five of those massive Lucrehulk class battleships at last count, while we have mostly just a few light warships, and only one Star Destroyer."
