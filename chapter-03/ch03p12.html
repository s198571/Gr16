		The next six months was very active for the Hawks Shipyards,
		they had nine ships they had to basically strip down to the keel
		then build back up again almost from scratch, essentially turning
		them into brand new vessels. In those six months the nine ships of the Challenger battle group
		got a serious facelift, replacing just about every major system onboard, three of which were
		capital ships, however the project wasn’t without its own share of delays, accidents and the occasional sabotage.
		</p>
        <p>
		In reality it took over a year to complete the refit, and Commodore Jack Hawks has been
		waiting in anticipation for this moment.
		</p>
        <p>
		Outside the ship work men and droids were quickly evacuating the slip way,
		just minutes before it began to depressurize for the Challenger’s launch,
		similar evacuation procedures were being carried out in the other slip ways.
		As soon as the slip way was depressurized the collapsible metal sheeting that
		covered it opened up like a flower, exposing the Challenger to its native environment,
		the docking clamps and tractor beams released.
		</p>
        <p>
		On the Command Bridge the Commodore watched as his crew began going over
		the final checks before they launched, and soon enough his xo came up to him and reported.
		</p>
        <p>
		“All systems are go for launch sir, and the shipyard control tower has signalled that we’re all cleared.”
		</p>
        <p>
		“Very good commander, take us out if you please,” he said smiling from his captain’s chair,
		placed just behind the crew pit so that he had an unobstructed view of his people and the main viewports.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Aye sir,” she said smiling, she loved this part.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Helm, engines back one quarter, standby to turn 90 degrees to port then fire up
		the main engines to full power to clear the shipyard,” she ordered sharply.
		</p>
        <p>
		The helmsman merely nodded and concentrated on the task at hand, firing the ships forward bow thrusters,
		moving the ship slowly backwards away from the slipway, its hull glistening in the sunlight,
		free of scorch marks and in new colours, a dark gun metal grey covered most of the ship,
		with dark blue trim on the edges, the main doors for the dorsal launch bay and at the top of the dual bridges.
		As the ship turned away from the shipyard the main engines lit up a brilliant blue,
		accelerating the ship away from its temporary resting place and into space, the other ships following shortly after.
		</p>
        <p>
		In the coming decades this particular would become both famous and infamous, hated by pirates,
		loved by the common citizen, and Imperial officers from other divisions would look
		down upon these Clone War relics with disdain. However the officers and crew of these
		nine ships didn’t care about what people thought of them, they just cared about doing their duty,
		but not for the Empire.
