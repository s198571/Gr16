				It was an hour later that Aayla finally cried herself to sleep and the doctor gave her
				something to keep her that way for a while longer, and Jack returned to the bridge,
				his xo having been informed of the situation down in sickbay had handled the day to day operations
				while the Commodore was down there. They were now only a day away from their destination and
				Jack decided that he had put off his duty long enough.

                <p>
				“How are things up here, Commander?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“All is well, sir,” she responded. “Hyperdrive is running at standard cruise velocity,
				we should arrive at Corellia in roughly twenty three hours, give or take fifteen minutes.”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Very good,” said Jack as he took in the view of Hyperspace. “How is the crew handling things?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“They’re still pretty shook up sir, and for that matter so am I.” She paused for a second.
				“I know you trust everyone on your ship, but for the right price anyone can be bought
				and if the Emperor finds out that you are harbouring a...” she took a discreet look around
				and continued as quietly as she could, “A Jedi onboard none of us will be safe from the chopping block.”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Maybe, but you have to remember that we have worked this crew for over two years
				and we know most of them by their faces and names, and we have the loyalty of both
				the clone marines and pilots. They’ll follow Max’s lead and Max is loyal to the Republic’s ideals, not the Emperor.”
				</p>
                <p>
				“It need only take one,” she said in a whisper so quietly that Jack had to strain his ears just to hear her words.
				</p>
                <p>
				“We’ll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it,” he said reassuringly.
				“Carry on Commander.” He spun on his heel and walked off the bridge, leaving behind a serene looking,
				but still very worried executive officer in his wake as he headed for his cabin to get some paperwork done
				and look over the dossiers of his six new Corvette captains, then get some shuteye.
				He wanted to be well rested for his homecoming, he hadn’t seen home in nearly two years,
				not since the Challenger had cleared the Shipyard’s docks, but sleep would elude him for most of the night,
				plagued by images of him and his crew being found guilty of treason by the Emperor and then
				publically executed, one by one, with an especially cruel punishment for Aayla and his xo,
				making him wake up in a cold sweat halfway through the night then promptly fell back asleep,
				though he was afraid to sleep again, for the images truly terrified him.
