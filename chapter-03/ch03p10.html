		“I wouldn’t dream of keeping your engineers out of the loop, Commander,” said Hal.
		“You will be the ones who will be maintaining her after all.”

        <p>
		Many more questions were raised and answered during the meeting, and by the end of it Jack had a light headache,
		so much information to absorb and process. The Commodore wasn’t an engineering minded person;
		he was a ship handler first and foremost, and a damned good one at that.

		Several hours later, just after the meeting was over, Jack managed to find himself a quiet spot
		on the station with a viewport that looked over his ship, the hull pockmarked with
		carbon scoring from several battles, war scars from a war that was nothing more
		than an oversized diversion for the galaxy’s peacekeepers.
		He sat in a soft, comfortable leather repulsor sofa, watching as work crews began taking off
		the Challenger’s outer armour and hull, exposing the insides of her for all to see.
		From a side door of the observation lounge, one of a dozen lounges in this one slipway
		came his twi’lek guest, still dressed in her revealing slave girl outfit.
		She sauntered up to him and sat with him on the repulsor sofa and wrapped her arms around him.

		“You don’t need to continue the act in here, my dear,” said Jack.
		“No secure cams and the viewport functions as a one way mirror, we can look out, but no one can look in.”

		“I know, I’m just staying in character in case someone walks in on us,” she replied
		as her arms began massaging his sore back and neck muscles. “It has been a very trying time for you, Commodore.”
		</p>
        <p>
		“Look who’s talking, you got released from sickbay just this morning,
		after nearly getting yourself killed in a dogfight,” Jack retorted.
		</p>
        <p>
		She remained quiet as she administered her gentle touch on him, studying the man
		before her and the ship that was currently being worked on.

		“Why are you doing all this, is it to get back at the people who betrayed
		the Republic and turned it into an Empire, or perhaps it’s something more personal?”
		</p>
        <p>
		“I believe in the basic principles of the Republic; however the Republic was doomed to fall anyway.”
		</p>
        <p>
		“Why?”
