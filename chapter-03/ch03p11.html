		“Because it simply grew too big and the bureaucracy was simply too much,
		I believe that the fracturing of the Republic was inevitable, too many opposing views,
		too much greed, the Jedi Order merely delayed the inevitable, and the Emperor accelerated it,
		then forcefully brought it back together again, though this time the tools being used now are
		not the ones of democracy or diplomacy, they are the tools of terror,
		and I believe we have both seen our share of terrible things during this war.”

		The young twi’lek Jedi Master could only silently nod in reply. She had seen and done much
		in her years as a Jedi, she was definitely not the poster child for the perfect Jedi,
		considering she had been down the dark path before, and as a result of the Jedi massacre
		she almost fell down that road again. At this moment though she felt that her fate and this human’s were
		inexplicably linked, as well as that ship, but the future was always in motion,
		impossible to predict and every decision a person made added another path for the road.

		“Do you fight for freedom? For Corellia?” she pressed.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Yes, I do. It is my home world, I’d do what I have to do to make sure that Corellia stays safe,
		and I think that even if the Republic is restored Corellia should stay independent,
		an ally of the Republic!” he said with conviction.

		“I see,” said Aayla thoughtfully. “How much are you willing to sacrifice for your beliefs?
		</p>
        <p>
		“What I have to, but I won’t sacrifice innocents if I have any say about it.”

		“Good, then there is hope for you Commodore, never let go of your beliefs
		they will be a helpful guide. I do believe that I never thanked you properly for
		what you did to save me. Thank you for not turning me over to the Empire,” she said
		and gave him a quick peck on the cheek.

		“You really want to get this deep into your new role?”
		</p>
        <p>
		“I chose this for myself, I feel I should stay close to you for now,
		besides the best way to hide something, or someone, is in plain sight,
		plus a little bit of cosmetic surgery and DNA alteration and no one will be able
		to identify me as Aayla Secura. From now on you should call me Kayla, Kayla Macula.”

		“Very well, Kayla,” said Jack in approval as he enjoyed the treatment he was getting from his new twi’lek ‘servant.’
