        <h3>Hawks Shipyards</h3>
                <p>
				An hour later Commodore Hawks and his senior officers stepped off of the Challenger
				and into the shipyard after everyone else had left, the senior officers traditionally
				the last to leave when the ship was to undergo a refit, only the Chief Engineer and his
				staff were still onboard locking down major systems and preparing the ship for its six month
				long overhaul. Meeting them at the airlock was a large man with a grey beard and sea-green eyes,
				the same as Jack’s, along with another slightly shorter with dark eyes, slightly greying curly hair and a light build.
				</p>
                <p>
				The first man stepped forward and embraced Jack like family.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Welcome home Jack,” Hal Hawks greeted his son quietly, but warmly.
				</p>
                <p>
				“It’s good to be home,” Jack returned as he hugged his father back.
				They soon broke apart and Hal took a quick look at his son’s entourage.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Well, look what we have here,” said Hal as he took in the visage of both
				Commander Hess in her casual duty uniform, and made it look good too,
				and Aayla Secura in her slave girl outfit, a mess of black veils that covered only her privates and her face,
				leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination. “I see that your taste has improved,” he said leeringly,
				which made both women nervous. “Any chance I could get some alone time with them?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Dad I’m only going to say this once. Stay away from Commander Hess, she’s my xo,
				not one of your airhead secretaries and the Twi’Lek is mine, you may watch her dance,
				but you will never have the pleasure of her flesh, she is very loyal to me,” said Jack,
				both as a warning and as an act for whatever cams or other surveillance there was in the corridor.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Very well son, your mother would’ve probably killed me in my sleep if I even tried,” Hal said ruefully
				and winked at both women. “At least she’ll be some fine entertainment after our little meeting. Come on.”
				Hal led them down the corridors to a small conference room with a viewport,
				which happened to have a spectacular view of the Challenger in dock.
				In the centre of the conference room was a circular conference table with
				several high-backed chairs surrounding the table. The centre of the table had been
				cut out and had a clear glass panel in its place where a high grade holo-projector was installed.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Well son, what sort of mess is the galaxy in now?” Hal asked.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Among the worst you could ever imagine.”
				</p>
                <p>
				“So you didn’t enjoy having a medal pinned on your uniform for your dedicated service by the new emperor!”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Dad the man gave me the creeps, if you could call what’s left of him a man,” he said
				remembering the feeling he got when he was close to the emperor and the heavily scarred and deformed face.
