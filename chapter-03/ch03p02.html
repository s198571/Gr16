                “Why?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Because it was the right thing to do,” he answered.
				</p>
                <p>
				“But the clones, they attacked me and almost killed me...”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Do you see any clones working in sickbay?”
				</p>
                <p>
				She glanced around and saw none, just a doctor and his army of pretty nurses,
				and no clones, not even in the other beds.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Are there any clones aboard?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“There are a number of them onboard, but they’re mostly just Marines and pilots for our fighters,
				the rest of the crew are regular volunteers from Corellia, Chandrila and even Alderaan.”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Why did they attack me and my fellow Jedi?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“This may be hard for you to take, but the Chancellor executed Executive Order 66.”
				</p>
                <p>
				“What is Order 66?”
				</p>
                <p>
				Jack withdrew a small data pad from behind his back and showed her.
				Her eyes opened wide in horror at what she was reading.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Every Jedi is now an enemy of the Republic, and the Chancellor has now
				declared himself Emperor and reorganized the Republic into the Galactic Empire,
				‘For a safe and secure society,” he finished sarcastically.
				</p>
                <p>
				Aayla reached out through the Force, stretching her mind out into the galaxy,
				searching for the light that was her fellow Jedi, but all she found was darkness
				with only a small number of candles to light it up,
				but the darkness was slowly blinking them out one by one, for each candle that went out
				another of her brothers and sisters died, the feeling of pain and loss was almost
				too much for her and she fell into despair, crying out both mentally and vocally
				at the emotional pain she felt as she got caught up on recent events, her previous injuries
				and situation had given her the focus she needed to block out the pain,
				but now it all came crashing back to her like a great wave that threatened to break her,
				until she felt someone take hold of her hand and draw her into an embrace,
				the Commodore lent his strength to her as she cried her heart out on his shoulder,
				the doctors and nurses looking on in sympathy at the poor stricken woman they saw her reduced to.
