		“Yes, it’s used in the making of Mandalorian armour, extremely strong and supposedly indestructible,”
		said Commander Ganto.

		“Almost commander, almost,” said Blissex.
		</p>

		“Before the clone wars I managed to cut a very good deal for the ore and the experts
		to forge it into armour from the then leader of the Mandalorians, Duchess Satine of Mandalore.
		The Mandalorian master craftsmen have been teaching us how to forge the metal and we’ve
		combined it with standard starship armour to increase its strength significantly,” said Hal
		with a very satisfied smile.

		“How long will these upgrades take to implement on my ships?” Jack asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		“No more than six months, we tested out most of these upgrades on an old Dreadnought class cruiser,
		we just finished perfecting the systems only just last month,” said Blissex confidently.
		</p>
        <p>
		The Commodore became a little apprehensive at that. “That was an old warship which you
		basically gutted and replaced much of the ship itself, these upgrades will do the same
		to my ships and we’ll probably be out of action for a year, and I don’t think neither
		the admiralty nor the new emperor will think much of a project that would
		keep us in dry-dock for that long, or possibly longer than that,” said Jack scathingly,
		knowing that these sorts of projects had a habit of running headlong into unexpected delays
		and problems, not to mention the possibility of corporate espionage and sabotage by rival companies,
		particularly Kuat Drive Yards, a very heated rival of the CEC, and by extension Hawks Shipyards.

		“I wouldn’t worry too much about that, it seems that your admiral has gained the Emperor’s trust,
		enough for him to allow this ‘special’ project of ours, especially since it’s merely a
		proof of concept project,” said Hal to reassure the Commodore. “However the Emperor has ordered
		that the rest of the half-built sister ships to be scrapped, in favour of those Imperial monstrosities,” Hal continued.
		</p>
        <p>
		“I didn’t know there were any sister ships,” said Commander Hess.

		“They were never completed, Challenger was commissioned a year and a half into the war,
		and was also just a prototype, a competing design with the Imperator class, but the Emperor
		and the senate wanted more heavy warships like the Imperator and Tector classes,” said Jack.
		“The carrier role was being more than fulfilled by the traditional Venator class
		and other dedicated carriers, and we needed a higher number of warships to counter
		the massive droid fleets of the Separatists.”
		</p>
        <p>
		“Mister Hawks, I assume that my engineering teams are going to be working with your engineers
		and techs on the refit?” Commander Ganto asked, hoping that this would be the case,
		he sees the Challenger as his, the Commodore just borrows it from time to time,
		and he was not about to let just anyone fool around with her.
