		Once again the doors for the Challenger's bow chasers opened up and presented their guns for firing. Both made some adjustments to their alignment, then charged up with a bright blue glow, then unleashed their energy in a pair of high energy plasma lances that converged upon their target. The Merchants Terrors command bridge. The shields glowed and rippled like water as the immense energies of the two converging beams hit with enough force to penetrate a standard Imperial class Star Destroyer's shields, but to the shock and surprise of everyone the shields held.

		"What the hell happened?" Commander Hess demanded of her gunners.

		"I don't know, the guns worked exactly as they did when we crippled those Recusant class destroyers, we should have cut through those shields like wet tissue paper."

		"I might have an answer, sir," one of the sensor techs said.

		"Go ahead lieutenant," Commodore Hawks prompted.

		"I just did a thorough scan of the Merchants Terror. It seems that Csalas has installed a couple of extra reactors in the bow of his ship, both seem to have dumped a lot of extra energy into his forward shield grid. That's what's enabled his ship to survive a full on attack from our bow chasers, but there seems to be a drawback. His forward emitters have been severely taxed," he said as he brought up a close up view of the Merchants Terror's bow and along the sides of the nose a few lines of hexagonal panelling, the ship's shield emitters, were emitting black smoke. "I guess the strain of so much energy being dumped into them, as well as our attack nearly burned out his forward shield emitters. One more blast and his shields will be cooked."

		"Continue fire, all guns, and load all forward launch tubes with the biggest and most powerful anti-ship torpedoes we've got in storage, concentrate fire on their forward shields. What's the status of the two Lucrehulks," the Commodore asked as an afterthought.
		</p>
        <p>
		"They're both still on the flanks of the of the Merchants Terror. Our fighters are having a tough time getting through their flack to launch their missiles and torpedoes. It's like a hail storm mixed with a tornado in there," reported one of the tactical officers.

        <p>
		"Tell Captain Richter to keep hitting those Lucrehulks with his bow chaser as hard and as often as he can, without blowing his own ship up in the process," Commodore Hawks ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Both the Endurance and the Dauntless are already engaging the Lucrehulk designated as L1," reported the tactical officer. As a confused look passed over the Commodore's face he elaborated. "Both Lucrehulk class ships are not in any of our databases. They might have been new builds that weren't commissioned into the Separatist navy, or maybe he stole them from the Neimoidians, or more likely he got them from the Hutts," the tactical officer theorized.

		A powerful turbolaser blast hit the command bridge at that moment, which made everyone stumble to the deck and almost threw the Commodore and everyone seated out of their seats. "We can theorize all we want about the origins of those ships after the battle is won! Gunners, set all turbolasers to salvo fire on the Merchants Terror, ignore the Lucrehulks for the moment." He thumbed his communications console and opened a channel to the fighter and bomber squadrons. "All fighters, listen up. I want all of you to concentrate your attacks upon the two Lucrehulks designated as L1 and L2 and the droid fighters. Your targets are their external weapons arrays, shield generators and engines, ignore the Merchants Terror for now, leave it to us."
