		"Razgriz, follow on my wing, I've got us a nice target to my two o'clock, thirty degree down angle," said Blaze as he shifted course, and the three other fighters in his flight followed on his flanks. War-Dog squadron split up into their three respective flights and went hunting. In a four fingered formation Razgriz flight dove right on top of the escorting fighters and took them out with a hail of blue laser fire, then continued on to the boarding ships. Blaze lined up the boarding craft in his targeting reticules, switched to missiles and let loose a pair of concussion missiles at his target. The boarding craft jinked left and right in an effort to throw off the missiles, but the range was so close that they had no chance. The first one hit and blasted off the heavy durasteel penetrator nose and the second hit the engine cluster, and detonated. A similar fate occurred to three more boarding craft, which in Blaze's mind was little more than a tiny distraction, as he brought his guns to bear on one of the last two, and cut loose. He pressed the triggers and kept shooting until the boarding craft broke up as Edge opened up with her own guns and blew away the last boarding craft.

		"Good Kill, now let's move on to the next target," said Blaze as he turned his fighter towards the action.

		"First wave of enemy fighters have been destroyed, and our fighters have managed to intercept most of the enemy boarding craft," Commander Hess reported from the crew pit.

		"Good. Relay to all ships, put us between the convoy and the larger group. Captain Macdougan is to take the Dauntless and his escorts to engage the ships that are directly attacking the convoy, while we handle Csalas main fleet."

        <p>
		"Sir, he's going to be outnumbered almost two to one. Shouldn't we send more?" Commander Hess asked worriedly.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Don't worry Commander, between him and the remaining escorts that are guarding the convoy he should be able to handle it," said Commodore Hawks confidently, but Commander Hess was still worried. "Commander, he can handle it!"

        <p>
		Reassured slightly she stood up straight and nodded to him. "Aye sir."

		Captain Macdougan acknowledged the Commodore's orders then broke off from the main group, along with his small group of ships, which included two of the CR90s, the Nebulon-B frigates Daring and Rapture, and the Dreadnought class heavy cruiser Renown.

		"Steady as she goes, helm. Send the corvettes and fighters forward to intercept enemy fighters. We can handle any that get past them," Captain Macdougan ordered.

        <p>
		Slowly the small force of six ships closed in. Immediately the missile frigates shifted half of their missile barrages straight at the incoming Imperial warships. In response all six ships began sending near constant streams of blue AA laser fire as both enemy fighters and missiles closed in. Like the first rush of water when a tsunami strikes, the missiles came first and was promptly destroyed by the near constant hail of gun fire being sent their way. The next wave was the droid fighters and the bombers they were escorting. The two corvettes moved forward along with the Dauntless' fighter squadrons and began shooting the droids out of the sky in droves. They fell by the squadron as the corvettes and fighters worked together to bring them down.
