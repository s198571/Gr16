		Back in the thick of the battle a certain squadron of Z-95s were currently engaged in a fur ball with a squadron of V-Wings, and Blaze and Edge were currently fighting to stay in the game.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Watch it Edge, four V-wings from your ten o'clock high," Blaze warned as he turned to engage, and hopefully punch out of this fur ball.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I'm with you," Edge acknowledged as she followed her leader in a snap roll and turn towards their attackers.
		</p>
        <p>
		The V-wings were smaller and had a higher acceleration, but they paid for that acceleration with almost no shields and very light armour, while the Z-95s they flew were more of a jack of all trades, with strong shields and good armour, coupled with a pair of powerful engines, the same type used on the larger ARC-170, made them almost as fast in acceleration, and only slightly less manoeuvrable than their counterparts.
		</p>
        <p>
		The first to open fire were the V-wings, their first shots of green laser blasts were deflected by the strong shields of Blaze and Edge's fighters, but they deftly avoided the rest of their volley and counter attacked with a laser volley of their own. Blue and green laser fire crisscrossed space in a matter of seconds, and two of the V-wings were out of the game. Both Blaze and Edge pivoted on their sides, using their fighters RCS thrusters to point their ships and their weapons at their last two opponents as they passed, leading their targeting reticules and compensated for slight changes in speed and direction, and let loose with blistering volleys of blue laser cannon fire and took out both enemy fighters before they could react.

        <p>
		"Good kill, good kill, now let's find us some more targets!" said Blaze as he led Edge back towards the fur ball.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Attention all War Dogs, we've got another escort mission, Y-wings are making an attack run on the capital ships sub-lights, they need to be slowed down!" said Captain Snow over the squadron frequency.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I would love escort duty, if somebody could scrape these guys off our tails," said Chopper as he dodged and weaved around laser fire from a V-wing that was dogging his tail. Archer came up behind Chopper's pursuer and put a concentrated burst of laser fire up its exhaust pipe, before taking the four o'clock position on Chopper's wing.
		</p>
        <p>
		"One tail dry cleaned, pressed and starched." said Archer, the grin he was sporting could be practically heard over the speakers.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Alright you jokesters, we've got a job to do. Form up ahead of Gold squadron, they've got ion cannons to use on the three capital ships engines. It is our job to make sure not a single one is shot down, so boost your engines and go to maximum acceleration, we're going in!" said Blaze as he took his flight into the fray once again in a classic wedge shaped four fingered formation, along with the rest of War Dog squadron. Captain Snow was ahead in the lead with his flight, while Razgriz flight was on his starboard wing, while the third flight was to port, but was one fighter short.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Nek flight, what happened to your wingman?" Captain Snow asked.
