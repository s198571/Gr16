		At the same time the small battle-group began to break orbit, each one in perfect formation, with Challenger in the centre and the Acclamator III frigates Dauntless and Endurance on its flanks with four of the six CR90 Corvettes flying in close formation to the capitals to provide anti-fighter cover to their blind-spots while the last two took point, along with the CAP fighters. As the Challenger and its battle-group approached the local asteroid field the ship's flight-deck was a scene of barely controlled chaos as flight mechanics began to fuel and arm the ships complement of fighters and bombers for the battle-group combat exercises. In the hour leading up to the exercises the 35 fighter and bomber squadrons of the Challenger were receiving their final mission briefings. In one particular fighter squadron known as War-Dog squadron which was composed of Z-95 Headhunters, piloted mostly by clones, except for four distinct individuals. All four were newcomers to the ship, having arrived as replacements after the squadron lost a good number of its most senior pilots to the military flight academies being set up all over the galaxy to serve as flight instructors.

		These four were from various planets across the galaxy. The flight leader was Lieutenant Darren "Blaze" Dunewalker from Tatooine, a dark haired young man with some serious talent. His second was Lieutenant Kei "Edge" Nagase from Eriadu, another talented flyer who also happened to be female, one of the few who managed to get into flight-school on her male-dominated planet. She has short black hair and slanted dark brown, almost black, eyes. The third was a big burly man from Ord Mantell, Lieutenant JG Alvin "Chopper" Davenport. Last but not least was Ensign Jason "Archer" Grimm from Coruscant, a scrawny young man with a short crop of curly red hair and barely looked old enough to shave.

		These four were in at the forefront of the squadron leader's mind, Captain Snow, a Jango clone with four shortly cut lines of white hair along the top and back of his head, as he took in the sight of the squadron he had been recently given command of. He had previously only been in command of one of the squadron's three flights of four fighters, but he knew his duties as a commanding officer.

		As he took the podium in the squadron's briefing room everyone rose up to stand attention, and he was glad to have such men, and woman, under his command.

		"At ease people, as you know there have been some changes to this squadron and a number of the other squadrons on this ship, many of our best have been shipped off to other commands or transferred to the new Imperial Academies that the Empire is setting up across the galaxy, to be replaced by recently trained clones who have only just finished training, or as in our case we got four natural born replacement pilots. These four I might add may be an eclectic mix, but for those who don't know yet, these four are what's left of the Razgriz Squadron, one of the most decorated units of natural born pilots, so I hope you my brothers have made them feel welcome," said Captain Snow, much to the embarrassment of Razgriz Flight and there was a gentle buzz of murmuring among the rest of the squadron.

		"Let's get to the matter at hand shall we," Captain Snow continued as he had an R2 series droid project a hologram of the system they were in. "As you know during our last series of drills the Commodore and XO were not satisfied with this crew's scramble time, over three minutes to get to action stations. The battle group is heading for the local asteroid field for some real world live fire exercises to knock off some of the rust the crews have been accumulating over the last year we have been stationed on the Hawks Shipyards. Our mission today is to perform fighter escort duty for a squadron of Y-Wings as they perform bombing run exercises in among the local asteroid field. To up the ante our battle group will be going up against the Concordia battle group. On paper we are roughly equal however they have more recent experience, because our ships have been in dry dock for a year, while they have been on patrol in the Outer Rim territories."
