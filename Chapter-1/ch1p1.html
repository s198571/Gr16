	<h2>Chapter 1: Death of Liberty</h2>	<!--Används bara vid nya kapitel-->

		<p>
			The Clone Wars were almost over. The death of both Count Dooku and General Grievous
			seemed to signal that the end of the war was nearing. The Jedi led clone armies were now winning
			on all fronts and the droid armies were being decimated. However the fate could sometimes throw
			some very twisted curveballs. At the very eve of victory the Jedi Order was betrayed by both the
			Chancellor, aka Darth Sidious, and the Chosen One Anakin Skywalker. The Chancellor issued Order 66,
			branding every Jedi an enemy of the Republic, while he sent his new apprentice Anakin Skywalker,
			now known as Darth Vader, to attack a Jedi Temple with his personal Legion, the 501st killing almost
			every Jedi inside with only a small number of them making it out.
		</p>
		<p>
			As Anakin continued to kill Jedi he became more and more steeped in the dark side,
			descending further and further into darkness that he could no longer be considered
			the good man that was Anakin Skywalker, he was now through and through Darth Vader,
			corrupted by an evil man and then later with the death of his wife, almost impossible to redeem.
		</p>
		<p>
			Caught up in the middle of all this was a young Captain called Jack Hawks,
			the commanding officer of the Challenger class Star Destroyer Challenger.
			He had served in the Corellian Defence Forces and then got transferred to the Republic Navy
			two months into the war. In his time as a career military officer he had gained a reputation as an
			excellent ship handler, a skilled tactician and strategist, and also a little bit of a ladies’ man,
			though he had no comment to that remark.
		</p>
		<p>
			The other thing about him was that he didn’t entirely trust clones,
			he respected their ability as soldiers, but he had prior experience with the template of the clones,
			the Bounty Hunter Jango Fett. His crew was for the most part made up of non-clones,
			mostly humans from Corellia with a small mixture of Alderaanian and Chandrilan volunteer
			officers from their respective defence forces, while the marines and fighter pilots were for the most part clones.
		</p>
		<p>

			His ship was on its way from an extended patrol of the Inner Rim when it was called
			to rendezvous at Felucia to help in the planet’s liberation. They had just dropped out of Hyperspace
			and Captain Hawks was looking out the viewports when his executive officer,
			Commander Mirialia Hess, came up with a data pad for him. She was a fellow Corellian so she shared
			almost the same coloured hair as he did, while his was dark brown hers was a couple of shades lighter and was tied
			back into a tight pony tail, while the captain wore his short.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Priority message from GAR HQ sir,” she said as she handed it to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jack read the message then had to read it again to make sure he hadn’t misread it.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Is this confirmed?”
		</p>
		<p>
			“Yes sir, it came straight from the Chancellor’s office on a secure channel,
			and sir the message used a Separatist encryption sequence.”
		</p>
		<p>
			The Commodore’s eyes narrowed in suspicion as he reread the message again.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Execute Order 66,” it said and below it was a description of the order.
		</p>
		<p>
			Order 66: In the event of Jedi officers acting against the interests of the Republic,
			and after receiving specific orders verified as coming directly from the Supreme Commander (Chancellor),
			GAR commanders will remove those officers by lethal force, and command of the GAR will revert
			to the Supreme Commander (Chancellor) until a new command structure is established.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Have Commander Max come up here,” he ordered.
		</p>
