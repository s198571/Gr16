			“Priority message from GAR HQ sir,” she said as she handed it to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jack read the message then had to read it again to make sure he hadn’t misread it.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Is this confirmed?”
		</p>
		<p>
			“Yes sir, it came straight from the Chancellor’s office on a secure channel,
			and sir the message used a Separatist encryption sequence.”
		</p>
		<p>
			The Commodore’s eyes narrowed in suspicion as he reread the message again.

			“Execute Order 66,” it said and below it was a description of the order.
		</p>
		<p>
			Order 66: In the event of Jedi officers acting against the interests of the Republic,
			and after receiving specific orders verified as coming directly from the Supreme Commander (Chancellor),
			GAR commanders will remove those officers by lethal force, and command of the GAR will revert
			to the Supreme Commander (Chancellor) until a new command structure is established.

			“Have Commander Max come up here,” he ordered.
		</p>
		<p>
			The xo merely nodded her head then got on the ship’s intercom calling Commander Max to the Command Bridge.
			Minutes later he arrived on the bridge clad in full ARC Trooper armour,
			he had been preparing his troops to enter combat, and he always wore his full armour while on duty.
		</p>
		<p>
			“You wanted to see me sir?”
		</p>
		<p>
			“Yes Commander,” replied the Captain lightly. “What is your opinion of Order 66?”
		</p>
		<p>
			“I believe that all lawful orders should be followed to the letter, sir!”
		</p>
		<p>
			“Even one that calls for the killing of thousands of innocent people, because that is what this order is,
			an execution order for every Jedi, branding every one of them a traitor to the Republic,
			when you know that they have absolutely no interest in controlling the government.”
