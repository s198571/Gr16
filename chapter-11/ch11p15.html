		"Would you mind checking on my companions?" Jack asked and the guard quickly directed two of his fellows to do so, while the two guards holding him upright moved him away from the room and into the hallway where they laid him down.

		The pain from his wounded leg threatened to make him black out, but he gritted his teeth and stayed conscious. One of the guards quickly returned. "They are both fine sir, the gas grenade just knocked them out."

        <p>
		Relief flooded through Jack's mind, now that he knew that Kayla and Mirialia were safe he drifted off onto unconsciousness.

		<h3>Theed Spaceport</h3>

        <p>
		Cad Bane barely managed to get to his own personal starfighter, a modified Rogue-class fighter, before Naboo security could apprehend him. He mentally patted himself on the shoulder for his preparedness as he could still feel the intense heat of the two blaster bolts that had hit him square in the chest, luckily he wore armour-weave underneath his clothing, otherwise he'd be a dead man. He quickly ignited his fighter's engines and blasted off out of the hangar and straight up and out of the atmosphere.
		</p>
        <p>
		He growled in annoyance as a pair of N1-Starfighters caught up with him just as he exited the atmosphere, and there was an Imperial warship in orbit that he had to get past. He tried to alter his heading and increase speed, but the N1s were still hanging on to his tail with green laser canon fire blasting through space, scoring a number of hits to his shields and forced him into a roll, which just so happened to bring him back on course towards the Imperial warship. He could now make out some details on the vessel blocking his path. It was a Tector class Star Destroyer, a flying weapons platform optimised for bashing other warships into submission.
		</p>
        <p>
		So, you are forcing me towards an Imperial warship with little point defence weaponry. Fine! I'll take your bait, he thought to himself as he pushed his fighters engines to the maximum as he set his computers to calculate a hyperspace jump to one of his many hideouts in the Outer Rim. He put his fighter on a highly erratic course and set his ECM generators to maximum as he approached the warship which was coming closer. He noted the alarms that alerted him that it was trying to lock him down with a tractor beam, but so far all they were getting was stray particles. He savagely grinned as he closed in, but noted that the two N1s following him had fallen behind and were maintaining a steady one and a half kilometre distance. He was then surprised as more alarms from his threat indicators went crazy, and checked his scopes.
		</p>
        <p>
		His eyes widened in surprise and horror as he saw the incoming shells and massed laser cannon fire come straight at him. He put his fighter into a tight corkscrew and avoided the majority of the incoming fire and focused all of his deflector shields forward. His fighter was jolted by multiple laser canon hits and energy pulses from the exploding shells all around him. He pushed his fighter's engines past the red line and continued to accelerate, aiming to get below the massive warship in front of him.
		</p>
        <p>
		What to him felt like hours took only seconds in real time as he managed to corkscrew his way through the relentless barrage, hug the ventral hull of the Tector and passed right by it. A simple beep told him that the hyperdrive was ready and he pulled the activation lever, jumping the ship into hyperspace and frustrated his hunters.
		</p>
        <p>
		He let out an expansive sigh as he felt relief that it was over, for the moment. He began looking through his pockets, then got worried as he checked his right breast pocket of his armour-weave shirt. He quickly saw the data-disk he had stored the commodore's conversation with the Jedi had been burned to a crisp by a lucky shot from that same commodore's holdout blaster. An almost indescribable rage came over him as he crushed the remains of the disk, then calmed down.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Alright, you got lucky this time, Commodore Jack Hawks, but next time you won't be so lucky," he vowed as he began to plan his next attempt.
