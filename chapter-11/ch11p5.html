		"Who are you?" she asked in a quiet yet deadly tone as she surreptitiously fingered a tiny white holdout blaster concealed in the folds of her dress as she turned towards this unknown adversary and her eyes widened in surprise as she instantly recognised the yellow kiffar facial tattoo that went across his face and nose.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Don't you recognise your old master?" he asked bemused as he quickly took her hands and began to dance with her.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Maser Vos, I thought you were dead?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"Almost was, my dear former apprentice. I was badly burned on Kashyyyk and took a long time to heal," he said quietly. His eyes wandered to the slim leather slave-collar on her swan-like blue neck and the other changes to her body. "You've changed, and you're a slave. What happened to you?"
		</p>
        <p>
		She gulped nervously. "I have been hiding in plain sight as the 'indentured servant' of Commodore Jack Hawks. He found me in my starfighter and has since been hiding me from the emperor's eyes and ears." She saw that this angered her former master. "He is a good man who believes in democracy, but now lives in a world of darkness and terror. I am trying to be the guiding light he needs to stay true to his beliefs."
		</p>
        <p>
		Vos looked deep into Aayla's hazel eyes and saw that things had changed on the inside just as much as on the surface. "You have a connection to this Commodore Hawks, don't you?!"
		</p>
        <p>
		She could only nod yes in response.
		</p>
        <p>
		"It's ironic isn't it? You were the one who warned me not to get too attached to my wife, and now you are the one who is in love with someone special."
		</p>
        <p>
		Her eyes widened again in surprise, both at the irony of her situation and at the revelation that her former master is now married. "You married that purple haired thief?" she said in astonishment, almost loud enough to be heard.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Careful Aayla, you don't want everyone to hear us talking. Besides, what are you and your master doing here anyway, this isn't exactly his scene?" he asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		"My name is now Kayla Macula! My true name is used only in private and where there are no prying ears to hear it. Besides what are you doing here?" she retorted.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I asked first. Your master is the commanding officer of an Anti-Piracy Fleet battle-group. No offense to him, but he is small-fry in comparison to most of the big-wigs that were invited here!"
		</p>
        <p>
		"He was sent here to be the representative for Admiral Rod. Apparently he hates these sorts of events. He also believes that we would have a better chance of speaking with the queen without drawing too much attention." Aayla lowered her voice even further. "We have reason to believe that the empire may soon catch wind of the queen's hiding of Jedi on her planet and may be considering military options for dislodging the emperor's hold on her planet. Our main objective is to warn her and any Jedi in hiding here and make her reconsider such plans."
		</p>
        <p>
		Vos' face took on a worried look. "It may be too late for that." Aayla looked confused for a moment and Vos elaborated. "Some of the Jedi in hiding here have already talked both the queen and the gungans into attacking the local Imperial garrison and power station."
