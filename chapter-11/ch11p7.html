		"That you always have at least two beautiful women at your side at all times, as evidenced by your two companions. I have also heard that you are a most capable ship-handler, having just recently defeated the Separatist pirate Captain Arulo Csalas."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Both are true and one of them is well-deserved, but Csalas has only been defeated and still has a sizeable force hiding out in the Outer Rim. He may have escaped my clutches, but rest assured we will catch him, sooner or later!"
		</p>
        <p>
		"Well, enough of such serious talk. I feel the need to dance, and this song just happens to be one of my favourites. Care to join me?" she asked, though it sounded more like a command.
		</p>
        <p>
		"It would be a pleasure your highness," Jack replied as he reluctantly disentangled himself from his two lovely companions and joined the queen on the dance floor.
		</p>
        <p>
		The music had a slightly faster rhythm to it, and Jack noticed it was mostly younger men and women and a small minority of officers who had managed to maintain their fit physique who were dancing to this tune. By the look of joy that seemed to break through the queen's ingrained neutral expression he could see that she was enjoying this dance, and surprisingly he was having a little bit of fun too.
		</p>
        <p>
		Soon enough the music slowed for a little while, and Jack took the opportunity to talk with her. "Imperial Intelligence knows about the Jedi you have in hiding here on this planet, and I just found out that you and the gungan Bosses have decided to follow the advice of a few angry Jedi."
		</p>
        <p>
		The young queen looked back into his eyes and Jack saw terror in those warm brown eyes of hers. Her voice barely above a whisper she asked, "If they know, why haven't they deposed me yet?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"Because the reports haven't reached Vader and his Emperor yet and our allies in Imperial Intelligence cannot sit on this forever. I suggest that you call off this attack immediately and get the Jedi off-planet as soon as possible! "
		</p>
        <p>
		"It is already too late, Commodore. The attack commences within the next couple of hours. The Jedi and the gungans are committed, and so am I. If we are successful it may be enough to show the other worlds that the Imperial war-machine is not invincible. If the attack fails and Vader comes then our deaths will show the Empire's true face," she answered her face a stone mask.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Then I hope for your sake that you have a very good escape plan, otherwise I don't see you surviving long," said Jack as he broke away from the queen as the last song came to an end. As he walked away the queen stood straight and regal, giving nothing away as she moved onto another high profile guest.

		<h3>Theed Palace,</h3>
		<h3>Servant's Walkways</h3>
		<p>
		In the hidden servant's walkways there was constant activity as various servants and droids in the employ of the palace came and went, carrying various luxury food items and drinks for the palace' near thousand guests of the evening.
		</p>
        <p>
		Among the many servants in the walkway a single tall and slim servant stood stoically as one of the higher ranking servants, one of a dozen managers began to give him orders. "I need you to get these up the ballroom bar, the place is starting to run dry, and help out with mixing and serving drinks when you get up there," the manager said shortly as he shoved a case of expensive wine from Alderaan into his arms.
