		<h3>Merchants Terror</h3>
		<h3>Same Time</h3>

		<p>
		On the bridge of the Merchants Terror Captain Arulo Csalas watched in his comfy command chair as his fleet was being systematically crippled or destroyed, and at that moment he felt true rage flow through him. The former Separatist officer, who had made his living off of piracy in the almost two years since the end of the Clone Wars, had become ever more filthy rich, along with his fellow captains who had elected him as his leader. Now he was seeing his tool of vengeance and profit being dismantled piece by piece, and the simultaneous crippling of three of his ships had not helped his blood pressure.
		</p>
        <p>
		Behind his command chair stood a TX-series tactical droid that functioned as the ship's xo. In fact the ship was crewed by nothing more than droids, plus himself and his harem who were in his quarters nestled deep within the armoured bulkheads of his ship.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Sir, our forces are being systematically destroyed. I calculate the enemy has a more than seventy percent chance of taking this ship. I advise retreat," the droid advised, but Captain Csalas had other ideas.
		</p>
        <p>
		"No. Move the fleet forward in full attack formation. All guns are to fire for effect, and begin deployment of our fire-ships, code Firestorm," he ordered and the droid complied with the speed and preciseness of an automaton.
		</p>
        <p>
		On one of the small light freighters a small group of blue colour coded B1 pilot droids received their orders.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Roger roger, code Firestorm acknowledged. Begin preparations!"
		</p>
        <p>
		The rest of the B1s went about their tasks, but like most B1s they couldn't help but comment upon their situation.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Well, looks like we're about to meet the maker," commented the lead droid.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I know. Our masters are so cruel," commented another.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I still can't seem to hit anything," said another that was aiming the ships laser cannons.
		</p>
        <p>
		All this chatter was heard over the comm. channels and Captain Csalas was glad that after this all of his old annoying B1s would be gone.
		</p>
        <p>
		The pirate fleet moved forward with all cannons blazing, they didn't care that the range was too far to effectively hit anything, but it was a good distraction as the light freighters moved out on the flanks of the attacking pirates. They flew a wide path so as to avoid the majority of the crossfire and soon enough they were in position, surrounding the battle group on four sides.
		</p>
        <p>
		"The freighters are now in position," reported the tactical droid.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Then tell them to engage!" Csalas ordered angrily as one of his last two Munificent class frigates got skewered by a pair of beam turbolaser lances and exploded.
		</p>
        <p>
		With a massive surge of acceleration seventy five light freighters of various designs dived straight into the battle. Almost immediately heavy weapons fire was redirected from the pirates against the new threat, but to the surprise of the Imperials the freighters shields held back the massive volleys sent their way, just long enough for them to detach their cargo modules they had attached to their hulls, which instantly blossomed into tens of thousands of missiles, and Csalas watched with glee as the Challenger and its battle group struggled to keep up with his special missile saturation attack he and his cohorts had cooked up.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Yes, burn Challenger, burn. Burn until your nothing more than a burned out shell, and you, Commodore Jack Hawks. You will burn for all the misery you have inflicted upon me!" Captain Csalas thought out loud, while the droids around him ignored their captain's maniacal musings as they continued in their assigned tasks like the thoughtless automatons they were.
