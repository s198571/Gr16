		Thoughts raced through her mind faster than the speed of light.

		Who was that woman? Was she a Sith? Or maybe something else? Possibly an Imperial ploy?

		Her thoughts were interrupted by the ship's intercom and intruder alert alarms blaring.

		"All hands, prepare to repel boarders, enemy boarding craft have managed to penetrate the portside hangar bay, all available marines report to the portside hangar bay," the voice of Commander Hess blared out across the ship, and Aayla felt completely useless as she stayed put in the Commodore's quarters. In that moment she made a decision that would shape her for years to come.

		It's time for me to leave the Challenger.

		<h3>INS Challenger</h3>
		<h3>Portside hangar bay, minutes earlier</h3>

		<p>
		Apart from the occasional shakeup from a heavy weapons hit it was relatively peaceful in the hangar bay, but that peace was suddenly shattered as the crewmen heard something clamp down hard onto the sealed hangar doors. Then an electric sizzle began and four points of light stabbed their way through the thick doors, then all four curved around ninety degrees and made a circle roughly three metres in width. After that several directed explosions detonated and launched the cut away portion of the door across the hangar. Several crewmen who were working there took cover and drew their service blasters while the crew supervisor called for backup.

		Out of the hole came several squads of BX commando droids who proceeded to slaughter everyone in the hangar bay with both blasters and vibro-swords. The ordinary crewmen put up a good fight, one of them managed to kill one with a lucky headshot, but help didn't come soon enough, and everyone lay dead on the deck as the commando droids split up into four man fire teams and proceeded to scatter throughout the ship.

		Two decks above Commander Max and his squad of eight ARC Troopers were running hard, trying to intercept the commando droids before they could complete whatever sabotage they had planned. Behind them the sound of three droidekas rolling could be heard and Max and his squad of ARC Troopers were hard pressed to ignore the instinct to blast them from existence.

        <p>
		As they turned the next corner they skidded to a halt right behind a quad of commando droids that were standing there in ready ambush positions, problem for the droids was that they were facing the wrong direction.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Enemy clones behind us, engage," ordered the lead commando just before it got blasted in the head by Max with his DC-17 blaster rifle, and the same happened with the rest of the commando droids. Max and his squad of troopers were then forced to take cover when another commando fire team ran up and opened fire, all dual wielding blasters. At that moment the three rolling droidekas rolled forward and instantly opened up, locked their weapons into place and raised their ray shields. The commando droids instantly focused their fire on the biggest threat, the three droidekas. At that moment the three droidekas opened up with a lethal barrage of blaster cannon fire. One of the enemy droids had the misfortune of being too far out of cover and got consequently the full attention of one of the droidekas and took multiple blaster cannon shots from head to toe that left it a crumbled blackened mess on the deck.
