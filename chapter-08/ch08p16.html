		Max gestured for his ARC Troopers to move forward as the droidekas kept the commando droids pinned in cover. One of the commandoes leaned out of cover for a second and fired off a shot which only glanced off Max's armoured left upper arm and left another blackened scar on his well used and pockmarked armour. He retaliated with his own blaster and shot the head off of the offending commando droid. The last two commando droids put up their own stiff resistance, but eventually fell when both got perforated by high powered blaster bolts from both the ARCs and the droidekas.

		"It sure is nice to have rollers on our side for a change," commented one of the ARC Troopers, nicknamed Digger. He wore standard ARC Trooper armour with a dark grey, off white digital pattern that was just as pockmarked and well used as Commander Max's own.

		"Let's move it boys, we've still got a droid infestation to eradicate," said Max as they set off once again down the hall.

		Several decks down below and further aft of the ship four droidekas stood guard of the main entrance to the engine room with full shields and weapons deployed and ready, along with a couple of squads of clone marines, all pure Kaminoan Jango clone veterans, who had taken cover behind the ray shields of the droidekas. Eight commando droids came rushing at the defenders and threw thermal grenades to clear out the droidekas and clones. The droidekas opened up with their blaster cannons and cut loose, sparing a few of their shots for the incoming grenades which detonated halfway to their targets, while shooting at the nimble commando droids that were proving to be hard targets to hit accurately. Through an interlinked combat networked the four droidekas opted for a simple saturation barrage, while the stormtroopers opened up with their new E-11 blaster rifles, firing in short triple-shot bursts, all aiming to take out the heads of the commandoes, most only managed to hit the armoured torso to little effect.

		"Damn it, I hate commando droids, and I hate these new blasters. They just don't have enough punch," lamented one of the clone marines as he fired his weapon again.

        <p>
		"I know. All I'm getting is torso hits," agreed another. "If I try to aim for the droids heads the shot often goes wide. I think after this I'll go down to the weapons-smiths and ask them for either my old DC-15S back or modify this damned thing to be more accurate," he continued as he sent another three-shot burst into another commando droid.

		"Good luck getting it back, all of the DC series blasters that were reserved for us regular marines were either destroyed or sold on the open market."

		More commandoes came running towards them and the clones merely glanced at each other before they all simultaneously aimed and pulled the triggers. Forgetting finesse they simply aimed centre of mass and kept shooting on full auto until they breached the commando droids tough armoured shell and tore their insides apart. Several more moved into cover and continued blasting, one clone got a trio of shots in the chest plate and went down in a crumbled heap. The death of a comrade only made the clones more determined to hold their position and protect the engine room.

		Behind the droids several blue blaster shots rang out and took out a pair of commando droids before they knew that they were being attacked from behind. The commandoes were now caught in a lethal crossfire, and several were completely confused, not knowing where the attack was coming from they entered the clones line of fire and were cut down with a blistering volley of blaster fire. Acrid smoke billowed from the smouldering remains as Commander Max and his ARC Troopers came walking through it.
