		<h3>Z-95 Headhunter, Razgriz 1, Blaze.<h3>
		<p>
		"Alright lady and boys you heard the Commodore, let's concentrate on the enemy interceptors. They've been going after the Y-Wings pretty heavily, so let's give them a hand," said Blaze as he led his squadron into the rapidly degenerating fur-ball.
		</p>
        <p>
		"All War Dogs, listen up. I want a full weapons and fuel check from everybody still alive," the squadron leader, Captain Snow, ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Sir, I'm at 75% fuel status, and I've used roughly half of my missile ordinance, no damage to report," Blaze reported.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Same here, except fuel status is at 76%," Edge reported smugly.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I've used roughly two thirds of my missiles and I'm down to 72% of my fuel, and no damage that I can tell," Chopper reported.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I've still got two thirds of my missiles left and 74% of my fuel, but I've taken a couple of hits to my starboard wing, but they appear to be only burn marks. Chopper can you confirm?" the young Archer reported and asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		Chopper eased his fighter over to Archer's starboard flank and dipped his port wing to get a better view. "I can confirm that its only a pair of glancing blows, most likely done by a droid fighter's laser cannons, or maybe by a stray flack round. The kid can still fly."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Acknowledged Razgriz flight," said Captain Snow.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Guys, we've got ourselves a vulture droid squadron not too far away, highlighting them now," said Blaze as target designator rings lighted up around several sharp arrowhead shaped fighter markers on the flight's scopes.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I see them Blaze, I suggest we go in from their relative high and attack them from above, they're so fixated on those Y-Wings that they won't see us coming until we've already killed them," Edge recommended.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I like it! Razgriz, follow on my wing," Blaze ordered as they skimmed along the surface of the Lucrehulk battleship they had just made a strafing run on, then accelerated away towards a section of vulture droids that were on the tail of some very frantic Y-Wings. Blaze lined for a long range missile kill, locked on and then launched a missile from his fighter's port magnetic launcher. The missile ignited shortly after launch and accelerated away from the fighter, along with three others launched from the rest of Razgriz flight. All four flew gracefully and were bang on target as one after another they impacted centre of mass on the vulture droids and blew them up.
		</p>
        <p>
		"This is Section 3 of Bomber Squadron 4, thanks for the assistance. Closing on target, opening torpedo tube doors," said the leader of the section of Y-Wings as they closed in on their target, a cluster of quad turbolasers that was currently busy shooting at the Dauntless. With flak exploding all around them the Y-Wings launched a pair of torpedoes each from their forward launch tubes, which flew straight and true and impacted heavily upon the turbolaser cluster. The first one destroyed the local shield generator, and before other generators could take up the slack and close the wide open hole the rest of the torpedoes flew in and punched through the lightly armoured quad turrets and into the hull, and detonated inside, which made it bulge out and destroyed a huge section of the vessels hull and several more clusters of turbolasers, missile launcher and mass accelerators.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Bulls eye, every shot counted," reported the clone commander of the Y-Wings as they peeled off and headed towards their next target, with Razgriz flying right behind them.
		</p>
        <p>
		"We're on your six S3S4, we'll keep the bad guys off your tails until we get new orders," said Blaze as he rolled his fighter and launched another missile at a Vulture droid.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Acknowledged Razgriz, our fighter escort got separated from us a little while ago, it'd be nice to fly with an escort again."
		</p>
        <p>
		With that they dived once again into the flak filled spaces between the enemy warships.
