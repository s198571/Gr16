		<h3>Csalas Fleet Emergency Rendezvous</h3>
		<p>
		Csalas's fitful sleep was interrupted as the stealth ship shook as it decelerated from light speed. Blearily he opened his eyes and saw a sight that brought a small smile to his lips. Eighteen ships were waiting for him, most of them looked to be in relatively good condition, with just a few more battle scars on most of them, except for a pair of Munificent class star frigates that looked like they had been mauled, with massive tears in their hulls and one of them had lost its command bridge.

        <p>
		He soon spotted the lead ship of this small pirate fleet, the Lucrehulk-class droid control ship Poison Nightmare, flanked by the battleships Devils Coral and The Shameful Gale. "Open a channel to the lead ship and tell them to prepare for my arrival." He was not looking forward to meeting his peers.
		</p>
        <p>
		The Stealth corvette made its way smoothly towards the fleet's flagship, noticing that the ship's secondary guns were tracking him, which made the former Separatist commander nervous, but like any smart commander he had a plan for every contingency, some of them planned out even before the end of the war. The corvette flew deep into the Poison Nightmare's port arm and landed in a marked out landing pad where a squad of B1s were waiting.
		</p>
        <p>
		He quickly exited the Stealth Corvette and met the squad of B1 battle droids. The lead droid in gold markings told him that they were his escort and that the fleet's ship commanders were waiting for him in one of the main conference rooms. Csalas's right hand went to a small transmitter in his pocket and activated it and then gestured for the droids to lead the way. They led him down a corridor and led him into one of the ship's mass transit trams, which then accelerated rapidly towards the rear of the ship then into the central sphere. Minutes later he was led into a circular conference room with several high backed chairs surrounding a circular conference table. There were 42 placements in all, but now only eighteen were filled and the droids followed Csalas inside, their blasters held in a relaxed muzzle down stance, but ready to raise them faster than any organic could.

        <p>
		Csalas noted the morose looks upon the faces of the surviving captains and took his place in the highest backed chair, while the battle droids took up positions around the room, curiously in positions that granted them clear lines of fire towards him.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Well gentlemen, it seems that I am not the only one who suffered a defeat!" Csalas commented darkly.
		</p>
        <p>
		"But you obviously suffered the most casualties, while I managed to escape with only the loss of the one of my Munificent class star frigates and two badly damaged ones, while the rest only incurred minor damage," the neimoidian captain of the Poison Nightmare stated. "Not only did you fail to destroy your target, you allowed that imperial get under your skin which led to the destruction of the entire fleet." The slimy neimoidian stood up from his seat and began to walk around the table. "I believe it is time we had some proper leadership for a change. Droids, kill him!"
		</p>
        <p>
		The droids raised their weapons, but not at Csalas. "Wait, what are you doing, no..." With fluid and precise movements of machines they aimed their weapons at the neimoidian captain and cut loose with a barrage of red blaster fire, his death scream cut off abruptly as he was blasted out of his chair and lay dead at the floor. The various alien pirate captains stood in shock at what had just happened, not believing what they had just witnessed.
