        <h3>Csalas, minutes earlier</h3>

		<p>
		The trip down the escape slide was always exhilarating for Csalas as he felt the rush of air in his ears, the rapid descent and the rush of the ground coming up to meet him. A thick column of air rapidly slowed his descent as he reached his destination, a hidden hangar meant to house only one ship. It was a long and narrow vessel, with an arrow shaped bow, a small cluster of four engines in the rear and number of small dual laser cannon turrets. He smiled as he saw the vehicle of his escape and headed for the ship's boarding ramp. Just before he entered he turned towards the bow of his former flagship, the general direction of the Challenger, and vowed, "Next time your ship will be the one to burn!" He quickly made his way to the cockpit and strapped himself into the captain's chair behind the two pilot seats where a pair of advanced pilot droids was sitting.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Are we ready to launch?" he asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		"We are ready. We are just waiting for your collection. They are being brought down now," the pilot droid to the left reported. An explosion just outside the cockpit made up Csalas's mind for him.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Forget my collection. Launch now!" he said in near panic.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Roger, roger, beginning launch sequence!"
		</p>
        <p>
		Second later explosive bolts detonated behind a fat slab of armour on the lower forward section of the Merchants Terror, dropping the deck out from under the escape ship and flung it out into space. Seconds later the ship ignited its engines and accelerated away from the battle as hard as it could, even as a squadron of passing Y-Wings attempted to intercept it. Their powerful engines burned brightly as they struggled to keep up with the rapidly accelerating vessel, they even managed to fire of a few shots from their nose mounted laser cannons, but the shields held.

        <p>
		"Damn it, gunners swat those annoying flies," Csalas angrily ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		The rearmost dual laser cannons opened fire with a fusillade of red laser cannon fire, bracketing a number of Y-Wings and destroyed one and damaged another two. The Y-Wings retaliated with a volley of proton torpedoes.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Incoming torpedoes, engaging countermeasures," one of the pilot droids reported. Chaff and flares were ejected into space in a starburst pattern, which spoofed a number of torpedoes and created a thick cloud of debris behind the ship which stopped and detonated the rest of them. The ship shook hard as the energy waves cascaded over Csalas's escape ship.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Engage the cloaking device, quickly!" the captain ordered and with a short electrical discharge and a watery ripple the ship quickly disappeared from sight and scopes and Csalas could finally breathe a sigh of relief. "Safe at last. Pilots, plot a hyperspace jump to the Coriander system." That's where my forces are meant to rendezvous if something disastrous happened, which I believe today qualifies.
		</p>
        <p>
		With that he drifted off to sleep as the ship made the jump to light speed.
