"A setback with our recent campaign resulted in a loss of several of my ships, including my flagship. However we are still fully operational..."
"The mighty Dosa says excuses are not wanted. You would do best to remember the deal you made with us. You owe us for the fuel and supplies we gave you. We want everything you took, or we will cut you lose and see how long it takes for Commodore Hawks to hunt you down," the protocol droid translated for the angry Dosa.
"We agreed to give you a thirty five percent cut of what we took from the convoys, the rest we would sell through our own middleman in exchange for repair facilities and fuel," said Csalas angrily.
"With your inability to take even a single convoy in this latest push, plus the preceding failed raids months before we require more to offset the losses the Hutt Cartels have suffered in supporting you. You will pay us or we will make sure that the Empire knows where to find you."
"Wait, can't we negotiate?" Csalas asked, just before the transmission was cut and Dosa's cruel laughter was heard as he shimmered out of view. Csalas's fists balled up tightly in anger, and a number of the captains sitting at the table wondered if one of their heads was on the proverbial chopping block.
