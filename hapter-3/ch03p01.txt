The Dark Times

Chapter 3: Reawakening and Refit.

As the Challenger flew through Hyperspace on course for Corellia a certain blue-skinned Twi’Lek 
had just been taken out of her Bacta-Tank and was being dried off and led to a nearby bed 
by a pair of nurses, helping her in and got her properly settled. 
The good Doctor Magellan reluctantly placed a call over the ship’s intercom for the newly 
promoted Commodore to come down to sickbay. A minute later Jack arrived to find her in a 
comfortable bed with a large amount of food and a bottle of water on a tray before her 
and she was tucking in wholeheartedly.

Before speaking to her he asked to see the doctor.

“How is she, she seems to have developed a healthy appetite,” the Commodore commented.

“It’s a side-effect of the healing process with Bacta, it leaves you very hungry, 
and right now she really needs to recover her strength,” the doctor answered pointedly. 
“Otherwise she’s fine, a little bed rest and some good food and she’ll be 
back on her feet swinging that lightsabre of hers around in no time.”

The Commodore gave a small smile at the good doctor’s words then headed towards the twi’lek Jedi’ sickbay bed. 
She was now wearing a white hospital gown and was laid out under the covers 
sitting up and eating heartily from the food tray in front of her, 
her head tails laid over her ample bosom, which Jack tried to avert his eyes from and look into her eyes instead.

“Master Jedi?” he inquired. She looked up from her food tray and started 
to examine him with her deep penetrating hazel eyes, and once again Jack felt like 
he was being scanned from head to toe and inside and out, 
though the feeling he got from her was a gentle flow of clean water washing away 
the taint he felt when he was with the Emperor.

“I’m Commodore Jack Hawks, the commanding officer of this ship and its battle group.”

“I suppose you are the one to thank for not just blowing my fighter out of the sky and killing me?”

“That’s right.”
