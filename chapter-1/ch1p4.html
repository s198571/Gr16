			She soon spotted the set of Hyperdrive Rings for her fighter and docked with it
			and inputted the coordinates for a short Hyperspace jump to a nearby system where she knew
			there were no Separatist or Republic forces, a neutral system, but just before she jumped
			another quartet of V-wings came in from behind her and opened fire at long range,
			very few of their shots landed, but two hit the rings as she made the jump into hyperspace
			and vanished from all sensors.

			INS Challenger

			Aboard the Challenger Jack was going over the various reports on the ground campaign on Felucia,
			the 327th Sky Corp was really giving the droid armies hell and had managed to capture the planet’s
			water treatment facilities before the droids managed to destroy them. He was looking at a
			general overview of the disposition of the Republic’s forces on the ground in the CIC
			when Commander Hess brought him another data pad.
		</p>
		<p>
			“We just received this report from one of our sister ships, the Black Crescent.
			They say that one of their CAP patrols spotted and intercepted a Jedi Starfighter
			that had taken off from the planet. The patrol was destroyed sir.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Jack studied the data pad with a critical eye, noticing how short the dogfight really was.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Walk with me Commander,” he said and led her towards the CIC turbolift.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Do we know who was flying that Starfighter?”
		</p>
		<p>
			“Yes sir, it’s in the report, Master Aayla Secura, or at least someone in her fighter and
			flew just as well as her.”
		</p>
		<p>
			“Well, that’s at least one Jedi survivor the Chancellor would have us hunt down,” he said
			dejectedly, not looking forward to the day he may have to give the order to kill her or any other Jedi.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jack took another look at the report.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Were the pilots that went after her rookies or something?” he asked,
			not really believing that a single fighter could win against four V-wing interceptors
			piloted by experienced combat veterans.
		</p>
		<p>
			“No sir, but I did take a look into General Secura’s file and she is an excellent pilot, not in Skywalker’s league,
			but certainly better than any Clone pilot, especially if she used the Force to heighten her reflexes.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Jack nodded at that. While Clones were excellent pilots
			they just weren’t in the same league as a Jedi when it came to piloting a fighter in combat.
