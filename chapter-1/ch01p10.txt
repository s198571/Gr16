“For now we keep a low profile and keep our opinions to ourselves, 
there’ll probably be a lot of people like us that see things the way we do, 
but there are many more that has bought the party line about the Jedi orchestrating
the entire Clone Wars,” said Jack in warning. 

After the impromptu meeting they went back on duty, quietly talking to the various department heads,
getting a feel for the crew’s reaction to the shift the galaxy has experienced. 
Hours later they received new orders, to head for Coruscant where the Captain would be
getting a briefing by the new Emperor himself. Jack hadn’t met Palpatine before 
and now this would be his chance to get a measure of the man. 
The Challenger quickly broke orbit and jumped to light speed. 
On the way they picked up a beacon from a nearby star system, a Jedi distress beacon.

As they closed in on the signal Captain Hawks appeared on the bridge.

“Are we close?” he asked.

“We’re seconds’ away sir,” reported Commander Hess, and seconds later the Challenger 
decelerated from hyperspeed and straight into the outer reaches of the system, 
quickly finding the source of the distress beacon.

“Reading as a Jedi Interceptor, its General Secura’s fighter,” she said surprised. 
“There is a lot of carbon scoring in the hull and her hyperdrive rings have been practically destroyed.
She has definitely been in a fight.”

“Bring it into the main fighter bay and have a medical team standing by,” the Captain ordered.

An invisible beam of energy latched onto the small Jedi Interceptor and pulled it 
into the main fighter bay, opening the smaller door and switching tractor beam emitters 
for the final stages of landing.
