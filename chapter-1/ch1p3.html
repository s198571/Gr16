			“Unfortunately sir it’s not up to me, if I could choose not to kill any Jedi I come across
			I would, but an order is an order and what kind of soldier would I be if I cannot follow
			orders.”

			Things became tense on the bridge as a number of crewmen started loosening their blaster
			holsters for quick easy draws.

			“Very well Commander, return to your men,” said Captain Hawks with regret in his voice.
			Commander Max gave a quick salute and turned sharply around and headed off the bridge
			towards the main launch bay, with a lot of thinking to do on the way down.

			“You think you got through to him, sir?” Commander Hess asked.

			“I hope so, otherwise we’re all dead,” responded Captain Hawks as he returned to looking out
			at the view of Felucia.

		<h3>Felucia</h3>
		<p>
			On the planet Jedi Master Aayla Secura was feeling the burns of several blaster inflicted wounds
			on her back quickly healing as she tapped into the living force that was in abundance on this planet,
			concentrated on healing her wounds with all her might while feeling the death screams of
			thousands and thousands of Jedi, including a fellow Jedi Knight whom had just been killed by one
			of her own AT-TEs on a different battle front on the planet. She came out of her self induced healing
			trance and slowly woke up, surprised that she was not face down on the ground,
			but looking up from the flat of her back with her arms crossed and clutching her lightsabre in her hands.
		</p>
		<p>
			She weakly crawled up on her hands and knees and looked over the former campsite of her troops.
			She had hoped that the turning of her troops against her was just part of a bad dream,
			but the burns on her back testified to the fact that she had been shot by her own troopers.
			She quickly searched through the ruins of the camp and found nothing left but scraps and most
			surprisingly her Eta 2 Actis Starfighter, still fully fuelled up, though the Astromech that she
			usually just left in there was gone, so she would have to do all the work.
			She could hear the thunder of battle not too far away so the struggle for Felucia was still ongoing.
		</p>
		<p>
			She gingerly got into her fighter and powered up, lifting off on its repulsors then fired the main engines,
			powering out of the atmosphere and into space. She was immediately buzzed by a small group of
			four V-wings that were instantly on her tail. A Jedi Starfighter was a very distinctive craft,
			and Aayla’s was very distinctive with its blue and silver custom paint job, and quite easily spotted.
			She quickly took evasive action, corkscrewing around the V-wings and came up behind them into the perfect position,
			and cut loose with her laser cannons, letting off short controlled bursts at her targets,
			blowing them all away in a matter of seconds. Clones may be good pilots, but they lack the skills
			of a Jedi that only a true ace of aces among those that are not Force sensitive could match,
			and these clones were far short of that.
