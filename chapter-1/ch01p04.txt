She soon spotted the set of Hyperdrive Rings for her fighter and docked with it 
and inputted the coordinates for a short Hyperspace jump to a nearby system where she knew 
there were no Separatist or Republic forces, a neutral system, but just before she jumped 
another quartet of V-wings came in from behind her and opened fire at long range, 
very few of their shots landed, but two hit the rings as she made the jump into hyperspace 
and vanished from all sensors.

INS Challenger

Aboard the Challenger Jack was going over the various reports on the ground campaign on Felucia, 
the 327th Sky Corp was really giving the droid armies hell and had managed to capture the planet’s 
water treatment facilities before the droids managed to destroy them. He was looking at a 
general overview of the disposition of the Republic’s forces on the ground in the CIC 
when Commander Hess brought him another data pad.

“We just received this report from one of our sister ships, the Black Crescent. 
They say that one of their CAP patrols spotted and intercepted a Jedi Starfighter 
that had taken off from the planet. The patrol was destroyed sir.”

Jack studied the data pad with a critical eye, noticing how short the dogfight really was. 

“Walk with me Commander,” he said and led her towards the CIC turbolift.

“Do we know who was flying that Starfighter?”

“Yes sir, it’s in the report, Master Aayla Secura, or at least someone in her fighter and flew just as well as her.”
