        The mood on the Command Bridge of the Challenger was sombre as they watched the results of the latest move made by the Concordia's corvettes and their counter move.
		</p>
        <p>
		"The last enemy corvettes have been eliminated, but we took some severe losses to our fighter and bomber squadrons, they're down to half strength!" reported Commander Hess with her head down as she took in the reports. "But they fulfilled their objectives, all three of Commodore Tisztelet's capital ships have had their sub-lights disabled and we are rapidly gaining on them."
		</p>
        <p>
		Jack however was cautious. "Just because we've slowed them down, doesn't mean they're not dangerous. He's still got some serious firepower on his side and both our fighter forces have been ground down to almost nothing, and the bombing raid on the Concordia crippled their launch bay, so now they are unable to launch whatever bombers they might have..."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Sir, incoming enemy strike fighters, two squadrons of ARC-170s, plus a pair of V-wing squadrons!" called out one of the scanner operators, and another rapidly confirmed his sighting.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Damn it, I thought we took out the Concordia's fighter launch capabilities, where did they come from?" demanded Commander Hess.
		</p>
        <p>
		"IFF tags shows they're from both the Gladius and the Gorgon and are rapidly closing in, our fighter squadrons are moving to intercept," said the same scanner operator.
		</p>
        <p>
		Outside several V-wings from the Dauntless and Endurance rose up from beneath the Challenger, having stayed in its shadow to provide one last surprise for anyone trying to bomb Commodore Hawks' capital ships. The V-wings of the opposing squadrons intercepted each other and the interception became a fur ball as they each jockeyed for position, using speed and manoeuvrability get a one up on their opponents, but the pilots of the opposing V-wing squadrons were roughly evenly matched, both in skill as well as in ships. As the ARC-170s passed by the fur ball several of them took advantage of the distracted V-wing pilots from the Dauntless and fired a number of laser cannon blasts from their wing mounted guns, as well as their tail guns as they continued on towards the Challenger.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Alert, incoming fighters, ARC-170s, closing fast and their torpedo launchers are armed, escorts and CIWS responding," reported another technician in the crew pit, just as streams of light laser cannon fire began to blaze across the view of the Command Bridge, and two of the corvettes moved themselves into position to cut off the incoming fighters.
		</p>
        <p>
		Onboard the ARC-170s the flight crews were surprised by the heavy fire they were taking, no other ship the size of the Challenger had so many point defence turrets, plus the fire from the corvettes, and now they were forced to dodge and weave around the incoming blue laser fire. One by one they fell as they got closer, first the squadron leaders, since they took point, and as they fell their strike capability weakened considerably, even their enhanced deflector shields only bought them a few extra seconds, but it was enough. As one the twelve fighters that remained of the original two squadrons launched all of their proton torpedoes in rapid succession, which emptied their magazines, then pulled away from their attack runs, though as they turned their relative velocity decreased and provided the perfect targets for the Challenger's and corvettes CIWS guns and shredded them in retaliation for the torpedo strike.
		</p>
        <p>
		However the torpedoes were still incoming, and automatic targeting protocols kicked in and the droid brains installed in the CIWS turrets shifted their fire from fighter interception to torpedo interception, and blistering streams of blue laser fire erupted in the path of the proton torpedoes. Dozens exploded at a time as the warheads detonated, one or two were destroyed only metres away from the shields, but some managed to get past the guns to impact the shields. Of the seventy two launched, only seven managed to get through, and they were scattered across much of the Challenger. Most of them hit across the arrow shaped forward hull, and merely squashed themselves as they impacted, their warheads merely dummies, while three managed to slip past the guns to impact the shields of the Command Bridge, and armoured doors slammed automatically into place just before impact, creating a loud clang of metal on metal on the bridge.
