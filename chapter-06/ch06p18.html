        Commander Hess looked over the shoulders of her subordinates as the simulated damage reports came in. "Seven torpedoes impacted sir, but none of them weakened our shields significantly, and most of the enemy fighters that attacked us were destroyed, it seems the CIWS was worth all the taxpayers money after all," she reported in her business-like tone of hers.

        <p>
		"Increase to maximum acceleration and prepare for broadside exchange, all batteries fire at will," the Commodore ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Broadside exchange? Sir shouldn't we maintain our distance and just continue blasting them from a distance?" Commander Hess asked in confusion, normally Commodore Hawks preferred to use long range artillery and fighter attacks to engage an opponent, not a close range gun battle.

        <p>
		"Commander, the Concordia and her remaining ships are putting out a lot of jamming signals, which means if we are going to hit them with any accuracy we're going to have to get closer, but don't worry. We're not going to engage in a close range fight. Helm, as soon as tactical has clear shots for all three of those ships point us directly at the Concordia so our bow chasers have a clear shot at her. Gunners, once the bow chasers fire unload everything those batteries have on the Concordia. The Dauntless and the Endurance will engage the destroyers!"
		</p>
        <p>
		"Aye sir," said everyone on the Command Bridge, and Jack let a small smile grace his lips as he heard their confirmation and they got to work.
		</p>
        <p>
		With a surge of acceleration the three capital ships and four corvettes moved forward and closed the distance with their opponents. As one they fired their bow mounted SPHA beam laser cannons, which gouged huge chunks out of all three of the enemy capital ships, in simulation of course, and proceeded to fire blistering volleys from their main and secondary turbolaser batteries. All sixteen of the Challenger's triple barrelled turrets fired in rapid succession, they never let up until...
		</p>
        <p>
		"Sir, signal coming in from the Concordia," reported Commander Hess.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Put it through, but maintain fire," said the Commodore as he turned towards a nearby monitor, which moments later showed a haggard, but no less bemused visage of Commodore Baran Tisztelet.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Cease fire, Challenger, I surrender, you win this one Jack, you young bastard!" said Commodore Tisztelet.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I'm no bastard, that just earned you thirty more seconds of getting your ships blasted to hell," said Jack with a small evil grin on his face, and Commodore Tisztelet's eyes comically bugged out.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Damn it Jack, if you don't cease fire the next few rounds my ships fire are going to be live, and I don't think the Admiral will look kindly upon the two of us if we really destroy each other's ships," Commodore Tisztelet retorted angrily.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Fine, all batteries cease fire and secure from training mode, recall all fighters and set up a CAP patrol, then get us out of the asteroid field. I want performance reports from all department heads within twenty four hours. Commander Hess, Would you join me in my quarters this evening? I want your thoughts on today's war game."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Aye sir, I'll just finish up her and I'll join you," she replied, then got to work getting the battle group out of the asteroid field.
		</p>
        <p>
		Jack watched her work fondly for a couple of seconds before he set off for the turbolift and headed down to his quarters.
