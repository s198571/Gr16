		"Thank the Force for small mercies, deploy decoys and sensor scramblers, I want their targeting scopes so filled with static they can't see a damned thing."

        <p>
		"Aye sir."
		</p>
        <p>
		From hidden side panels on the Ghost's hull small oval shaped pods were launched, some were electronic signature decoys, designed to fool sensors that they were the Ghost, while the rest were high powered sensor jammers, designed to confuse and disrupt every known form of scanner, except for the venerable line of sight optical tracking systems.

		The captain of the light cruiser became ever more frustrated, then decided something drastic. He launched a quartet of seismic charges into the general area of where they knew the Ghost was. They accelerated for their detonation points on powerful one-shot rockets and detonated. Powerful energy shockwaves knocked the Ghost around but did little damage, but the jammers and decoys were destroyed, which cleared up their scopes enough for a target lock. With a quick ranging shot from one of its bow turbolaser cannons they confirmed positive lock, then went full auto on all forward guns, a barrage that even a fully shielded and undamaged Ghost would not have escaped unharmed from. Even in training mode the sheer number of hits that landed on their shields still shook the ship, and the war-game simulator program automatically knocked them out.

		"Sir, simulator says we're out of the fight," reported lieutenant Rider in disappointment, they were so close to escaping.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Well you can't win every fight. Do we know what happened to the Shadow?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"Negative sir, she's not on any of my scopes, either she's running silent or she's left the asteroid field," reported the sensor officer.
		</p>
        <p>
		"No, if I know Maxwell I bet she's laying in wait somewhere running silent, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, but we can't be worrying about her now. Helm, plot a course out of the war-game's combat area, we've played our part, now it's time for the rest to do theirs."

		"Commodore, we just lost the Ghost sir, Commander Maxwell reports that they used seismic charges to flush them out. The Shadow managed to elude them, and is now attempting to get close to the Concordia, I think Maxwell is trying to get some payback," reported Commander Hess.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Order the Shadow to fall back and provide surveillance on the Concordia for the moment. Order the first and second waves to engage, all ships are to move forward into the asteroid field."
		</p>
        <p>
		"But sir, he knows we're coming, he'll have the advantage," said Commander Hess worriedly.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Maybe, but we're more or less even now, the Ghost's and Shadow's attacks have moved their light cruisers out of escort position, which has left those particular ships vulnerable and exposed. Take us into the asteroid field, Commander!"
