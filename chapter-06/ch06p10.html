		"Aye sir!"

        <p>
		With that the rest of the Challenger battle-group entered the asteroid field, moving carefully to avoid the larger asteroids and smaller chunks of rock were deflected by their shields. The corvettes were up front, using their own powerful close-range scanners to sniff out any potential ambushers, with the Challenger, Dauntless and Endurance stretching out their own scanners, the scanning beams practically announcing that they were coming in.

        <p>
		"Sir, we're lighting this asteroid field up like a Cloud City Casino, I thought that you wanted us to go in quietly, make it harder for them to get a lock on us?" Commander Hess queried.
		</p>
        <p>
		"We're also blinding their own scanners, all they can see are the large rocks and us. Launch all remaining fighters, I want at least three squadrons staying behind to protect the capital ships, while the rest engages the enemy fighters and capital ships."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Aye sir, scrambling fighters!"
		</p>
        <p>
		Less than a minute later the remaining squadrons of fighters launched from the Challenger, Dauntless and Endurance. From the Challenger came 120 Z-95 starfighters, 96 Y-Wing strike-bombers, 48 ARC-170 strike fighters modified for anti-ship attacks, along with 192 Eta 2 Interceptors, while the Dauntless and Endurance launched three squadrons of V-Wings each from launch-bays on the lower hull, dropping quickly from the ship then got into escort formation with their mother-ships.

		Ahead of this new wave of fighters was a flight of four black with red trim Z95 Headhunters, flying in the classical four-fingered formation, flying alongside their drab grey with Imperial Seal clone comrades, and heading straight towards the enemy ahead. Blaze looked down at his instruments and could see almost nothing on his long-range scopes, the intense scanning beams were clouding them up.

        <p>
		"Hey, what are those guys back on the Challenger doing, they're blinding our scopes with those intense scans of theirs," said Chopper in frustration over the comm. channel.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Relax Chopper, they're covering our approach with those scanning beams, the Concordia battle-group won't see us until we're right on top of them," said Edge in a calming tone.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I still don't like it," grumbled the large Mantellian.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Cut the chatter Razgriz flight," ordered Captain Snow. "We're getting close to the target, so unless the enemy spots and engages us I want full comm. silence on all channels, understood?"
		</p>
        <p>
		Everyone merely keyed their comm. systems once for confirmation that the order was received and understood, and Blaze took a moment to enjoy the silence, the calm before the firestorm. He and his flight functioned as one, staying in perfect formation as they dodged around asteroids, and enjoyed the feeling of freedom flying gave them. Alas it was over quickly as they entered a mostly clear area of the asteroid field, a narrow gap between the orbital belts of asteroid fields, one of the local asteroid belts little quirks.
