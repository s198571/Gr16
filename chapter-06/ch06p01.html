        <h2>Chapter 6: War Game</h2>
                <p>
				Soon enough the shuttle and its fighter escort arrived back aboard the Challenger handled expertly by their pilots and guided in by computer controlled guidance beacons, the fighters landed in the main hangar while the shuttle was directed to the starboard landing bay.
				</p>
                <p>
				As the shuttle's two passengers disembarked they noticed Commander Hess walking towards them as they came down the ramp. She stopped a couple of metres from them and saluted the commodore, which he returned.
				</p>
                <p>
				"Permission to come aboard commander?" he asked, the ancient custom easily rolled off his tongue.
				</p>
                <p>
				"Permission granted sir, and welcome aboard," she responded smiling. "How was the meeting with the admiral?"
				</p>
                <p>
				"Informative," he answered as the trio began walking away from the shuttle. "We'll be staying here for a couple of days while we await some new additions to the battle group, so I need you to set up a series of drills for the crew on all the ships, I want them as sharp as a laser when they arrive."
				</p>
                <p>
				"What kind of additions will we be getting?" she asked as both curiosity and worry welled up.
				</p>
                <p>
				"We'll be getting ten ships, the Acclamator class escort carrier Intrepid, five Dreadnought class cruisers and four of the brand new Nebulon-B escort frigates," he said as he handed over a data-disk to his xo. "This contains all the details on our new brothers-in-arms."
				</p>
                <p>
				"The Intrepid, that's Captain Rothgild's ship," she said in delighted surprise.
				</p>
                <p>
				"You know him?" Kayla asked.
				</p>
                <p>
				"Not him, her," answered Commander Hess.
				</p>
                <p>
				Kayla's brows rose halfway up her forehead. "I didn't know that there were any female captains in the Imperial Navy."
				</p>
                <p>
				"There were in the Republic Navy, though their numbers are dwindling at a rapid pace," said Jack as they continued towards his quarters.
				</p>
                <p>
				"She was a couple of years ahead of me at the Corellian military academy, and many of us looked up to her as a role model," said Commander Hess. "I even requested a berth aboard her ship, before you offered me the position as xo of the Challenger, sir."
				</p>
                <p>
				"I didn't know that," said Jack in surprise.
				</p>
                <p>
				"When I got blacklisted by Delmar I guess she believed the rumours more than my record."
				</p>
                <p>
				"I think I'll have a little talk with Captain Rothgild when she arrives," said Jack as he and his two companions continued down the corridors to his quarters. "After you've disseminated the information to the other ship captains and we've conducted today's training drills I would like a word with you in private, my quarters please."
				"Aye sir," she said as she saluted and headed up to the Command Bridge while Jack and Kayla continued on to his quarters.
