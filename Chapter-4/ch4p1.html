        <h2>Chapter 4: Shakedown</h2>
                <p>
				The asteroid belt of the Corellian system is a very chaotic place,
				asteroids flying all over the place along a set orbital path,
				the asteroids ranging in size from small pebbles to planetoid sized chunks of rock,
				which was the target for the Challenger battle group today.
				After over a year in dry dock the Commodore and his crew were just itching
				to take her out for a spin, but so far over the past three months there had been
				a lot of problems, necessitating the ships of the battle group to return to the shipyards.
				Mostly small things, but now it was time to begin testing out the ships weapon systems.
				</p>
                <p>
				The planetoid that was their target had a number of mineral deposits that were
				very valuable and useful in the construction of ships, and Hal Hawks thought that
				this would be like hitting two birds with one stone, they get to test the weapon systems
				while he gets the mineral wealth held in that planetoid.
				</p>
                <p>
				“All hands man your battle stations,” Commodore Jack Hawks commanded,
				his voice sounding on every deck of the ship, and the crew jumped into action.
				Fighters were fuelled up and ordinance loaded, weapons stations manned and
				weapons began powering up. The xo had an old fashioned mechanical pocket chronometer
				which she used to time the crew’s response time, and when all stations were manned
				and ready she clicked the chronometer to stop.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Three minutes and twelve seconds, sir. Way to slow,” she barked out at the crew over the intercom.
				</p>
                <p>
				“All ships, report in response times,” the Commodore ordered.
				</p>
                <p>
				The times soon came in. The Dauntless had a response time of three minutes twenty two seconds,
				while the Endurance was three minutes twenty one. Captains Macdougan and Richter were both
				annoyed with their crew’s response time being so rusted, though it was to be expected
				since they had been at liberty for almost a year, and this was their first combat drill.
				The escorts however had a response time of one minute thirty seconds, not bad for small escort corvettes.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Gentlemen, that is not good enough, I want to get our response time down to less than two minutes.
				Schedule more drills and exercises as you see fit captains, Commander,” he said from his command chair,
				not liking what he had seen. The response time of the crew before the refit
				had been no more than two minutes flat, and he knew the crew could perform far better than this.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Commander, coordinate with the various department heads for more drills with the crew,
				I want that response time cut down to under the two minute mark ASAP, in the meantime
				let’s try out our new teeth.”
                </p>
