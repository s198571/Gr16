			“Thank you for escorting me Captain,” she said a little nervously.
		</p>

			“Any time Commander,” he said reassuringly, the Commander had been under a lot of stress today
			and was a little scared of what the future would hold now that the Jedi were gone,
			he himself felt a little trepidation at the thought of a galaxy without any Jedi.
			He continued on to his own quarters to collapse into his own rack, today had been a long day
			and he was more than ready for a little shut eye.

			The next day started out as any other day for the Captain. He woke up, got into his
			refresher unit and washed and dried himself, then got his uniform on, then headed towards the
			Captain’s Mess where only the captain and a small number of officers were allowed and today
			he was playing host to almost his entire senior staff, most notably his Executive officer
			Commander Mirialia Hess, Chief Engineer Commander Rikard Ganto, Chief Medical Officer
			Doctor Victor Magellan and Clone Commander Max.

			Things were tense this morning as just about everyone felt a little leery of the
			Clone that commanded the ship’s marine contingent and could probably take the ship
			with little difficulty if he wanted to. Commander Max took it in stride,
			knowing that at least from this crew he and his brothers wouldn’t be getting a pat on the back
			for their role in Order 66.

			From a side door a young yeoman came in and whispered something in Commander Hess’s ear.
			She nodded and ordered the young man to turn on the main monitor, which normally just showed an artist’s
			impression of the Challenger. It was now depicting a speech that was being made by the Chancellor in the Senate.

			“The Jedi, and some within our own Senate, had conspired to create the shadow of separatism
			using one of their own as the enemy's leader… The Jedi hoped to unleash their destructive power
			against the Republic by assassinating the head of government and usurping control of the clone army.
			But the aims of would-be tyrants were valiantly opposed by those without elitist, dangerous powers.
			Our loyal clone troopers contained the insurrection within the Jedi Temple and quelled uprisings
			on a thousand worlds… The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.
			Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.”

		<p>
			A shiver passed down everybody’s spine, knowing that the Jedi Order was now considered enemies of the Republic.
		</p>
		<p>
			“These have been trying times, but we have passed the test. The attempt on my life has left
			me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.
			The war is over. The Separatists have been defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.
			We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.”
