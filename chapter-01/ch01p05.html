			“The Black Crescent’s report also said that another CAP flight, one of ours,
			managed to intercept her just before she jumped to light speed.
			They also plotted every possible destination along her last known trajectory,
			and taking into account of everything in range of that ship of hers,
			it spat out dozens of possibilities, like trying to find a needle in an astronomically large haystack.”

			“No sir, I didn’t, however I can’t prevent anyone else from drawing the same conclusions
			as I did if they find this info,” said apologetically.

			and hopefully she’ll be able to evade capture.”

			quarters, since it was on the way to his anyway.
