			She felt the light tug of the tractor beam locking onto her ship, but her mind was fogged
			by the lack of oxygen and the loss of blood she had suffered from her recently reopened wounds,
			rendering her unable to fully comprehend what was happening to her until she saw the gaping maw
			of a huge Venator class Attack Cruiser’s fighter bay. Adrenaline surged through her veins,
			preparing for a fight, but found that blood loss and oxygen deprivation combined to make her body extremely sluggish.
		</p>
		<p>
			“They found me, by the Force they found me and now they intend to finish the job,” she thought sluggishly
			to herself as she unclipped her lightsabre from her belt and gripped it tightly in her hands,
			though she felt that she didn’t have the strength to fight off everybody on the ship she
			did have the strength to give them a good fight.
		</p>
		<p>
			Her fighter was gently guided in by the ship’s tractor beam crews, and then lowered down
			onto the deck of the hangar bay, where a medical team was standing by.
			With great haste the ground crew moved in and secured the fighter, checking over
			all of its vital systems and locking down any fuel or hydraulic leaks, then popped
			the cockpit hatch open. Suddenly, with a snap hiss, a lightsabre sprang to life under
			the chin of one of the technicians that had just popped open the hatch of her fighter.
		</p>
		<p>
			“What ship is this?” she asked, the steel in her voice told the tech that this woman was not to be trifle with.
		</p>
		<p>
			“You’re aboard the Challenger, Master Jedi, we just rescued you...”
			At those words she raised her lightsabre a little bit higher under his chin, not enough to burn flesh,
			but enough to start singeing the short growth of beard under his chin.
		</p>
		<p>
			“The Republic just betrayed me and every Jedi in the Order; I felt the death screams
			of all of them through the Force, and now silenced.” Her strength started to waver.
			“If you are here to kill me just do it.” She then promptly collapsed back into her seat
			and deactivated her lightsabre, turning it off was the last thing she consciously did
			before the sweet embrace of unconsciousness claimed her.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tech took the weapon from her as the medical team got her out of her fighter
			and took a good long look at it, a simple and beautifully crafted weapon it shone
			in the light from the overhead lights. As the medics got her on a stretcher he put
			the weapon on it with her before she was rushed off to the sickbay then he got back
			to checking out her fighter.
		</p>
		<p>
			The medical team rushed her through the various hallways and a turbolift to get to sickbay,
			not slowing down for a second because of the amount of blood that she was bleeding,
			and if they didn’t get her to sickbay soon she would die. She went into cardiac arrest
			once and they had to do heart compressions while still racing through the hallways
			just to keep her heart going, just long enough for her to get into sick bay.
			When she arrived she was near death and Doctor Magellan and his team began stripping her
			of what was left of her clothes and unceremoniously dumped her into the Bacta tank.
			Within minutes the Bacta began its work, her lifesigns stabilized
			and she was out of immediate danger, the clear bluish white fluid
			improving and quickening the healing process.

			Captain Hawks meanwhile had just come down to the main fighter bay,
			right after Master Secura had been rushed off to sickbay for an appointment with a Bacta tank,
			he was looking over Master Secura’s fighter, he hadn’t seen many of the customized Eta-2s
			that the Jedi used and he was curious. What he saw didn’t impress him much.
			Both of the S-foils had been blown off, lots of carbon scoring across the hull and only one intact laser cannon.
		</p>
		<p>
			He quickly found the deck chief in charge of the fighter, who was shaking his head in resignation
			at the very sorry state of Secura’s fighter.
		</p>
		<p>
			“So, what’s the verdict, Chief?” Captain Hawks asked.
