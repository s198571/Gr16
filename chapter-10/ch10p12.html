		Bane merely sneered at the holo. "And what sort of job does the powerful Arulo Csalas want me to do for him that you could not do yourself?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"I need you to eliminate a certain Imperial officer," stated Csalas as a holo-image of the target replaced his visage. "His name is Commodore Jack Hawks, he recently caused a serious setback for my fleet of pirates and I need him permanently taken out of the picture."
		</p>
        <p>
		"I heard of that little mess. He won't be an easy target to get to, he no doubt doesn't leave his command ship all that often and only for a day at a time which is almost impossible to predict," hedged Bane.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Fortunately I know where he is going to be next week. He is being sent to Naboo to attend the Festival of Lights as his commanding officer's representative. That should provide you with more than enough opportunity to kill him."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Well now, you have my attention. If I'm going to take this job I'll need an advance on my fee, for various expenses, you understand."
		</p>
        <p>
		The pirate's face twisted distastefully at the sound of that. "I'll pay you one quarter in advance, the rest I'll pay upon completion of the mission, and let me make this clear, this is not a negotiation!"
		</p>
        <p>
		"You've got a deal pal, but remember I always collect my due from my employers," said Bane, smirking at the annoyed look upon the former Separatist officer, just before the holo shut down and a data-chip popped out of the droids little head and Bane took it and began to leave the cantina, only to come face to face with Cato Parasitti.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Remember me?" he asked quietly as the clawdite bounty hunter instantly recognized Bane and went for her side-arm, but Bane was faster as he shot and killed her with a single blast from his custom heavy blaster pistol into her chest, who fell down to the deck smoking from the blaster wound, instantly cauterized.

        <p>
		Absentmindedly he tossed a few local credits at the man at the bar, an amphibian bartender. "Scrape that scum off the floor before it stinks up the place even more than it already is."
		</p>
        <p>
		The bartender nodded and pocketed the credits as Bane left The Bolthole, while cleaning droids began to dispose of the dead body on the floor.

		<h3>Hawks Shipyards</h3>

		On the way back to the Challenger on the repulsor sled Commander Hess and Commodore Hawks remained silent. The tension between them grew until Jack could no longer take it. He quickly gripped her right upper arm and stepped off the sled only a few dozen metres away from the docking tube and into an observation dome overlooking their ship. He quickly sealed the door and blacked out the observation dome's window so none of the workers working on the Challenger wouldn't see them.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Alright Commander, what's your history with Colonel Riskovat?" he asked directly, still gripping her by her upper arm. A moment later she overcame her shock of Jack manhandling and roughly shook him off of her. Her eyes tightened and her mouth twisted into an ugly sneer.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Don't you dare touch me like that again," she quickly spat back at him.
