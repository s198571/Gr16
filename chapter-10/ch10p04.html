		"I know we'll probably make a fair amount of credits with the navy selling off the ships we've captured, but it's nothing more than a small bonus for us," said Jack as he quickly did some mental calculations of what the Imperial Navy would probably get for selling the five relatively intact ships they had captured and that the crews that captured them get ten percent of the proceeds to be divided among the crew, with one eighth to himself, the commanding officer of the battle group, two eighths to be divided amongst the senior officers, the rest would be divided up equally amongst the rest of the crew.

		"While that would be a nice bonus I take it you haven't seen what's in the cargo holds of those two Lucrehulks?" the Commander asked with an uncharacteristically mischievous voice.

		"Aside from more battle droids that might be worth a little if we sell them to the Corporate Sector or just melt them down for their raw materials..." the Commodore hypothesized.

		"I went through the ships manifests and found something very interesting, which I just had Commander Ganto confirm, which I assume you're here to do," she said hopefully.
		</p>
        <p>
		Chief Engineer Ganto sported the same type of grin that Commander Hess sported."Oh we've confirmed it alright, there are literally several hundred tons of valuables aboard those two converted cargo-ships. For instance one of their cargo bays has a huge number of just platinum ingots from floor to ceiling."

		Everybody's ears perked up at that statement and everyone was mentally adding credit signs in the three senior officers eyes as they thought about what they were all going to get for all that loot. The ships themselves became the property of the navy, but the contents of the prizes became the property of the crews who captured them to be sold or kept as trophies if they wanted to.

		"Well then, looks like we'll all be getting some serious bonuses for this little venture," said Jack, who then had a quick thought. "Make sure the shares for the servicemen who died gets to their families!" That quickly snapped everybody out of their reverie, remembering the price in blood they had just paid.

		"How are those slaves one of the marine fire-teams rescued?" Commander Hess asked to divert the thoughts of everyone in the CIC.

		"The doc says they'll be in for a rough couple of weeks as they go through withdrawal. The mental scars however are going to take a long time to heal, probably the longest," said Jack as he remembered the two former Jedi in sickbay and a hot fury welled up inside him as he remembered what one of them did to a very close friend of his who had business at the Jedi Temple that fateful day.

		"We should be ready to leave in a couple of hours. Follow-up teams of salvagers will probably pick up what we missed and they'll be here within the hour, so no need to needlessly exhaust ourselves," said Commander Hess, before she realized her small slip-up.
		</p>
        <p>
		"That's right Commander, we shouldn't have to over-exert ourselves for such a simple operation," the Commodore said smiling. "I'll take the conn here, you go to your quarters and rest, you've been up here almost twelve hours straight and you need the break more than I do."
		</p>
        <p>
		"But sir..." she protested.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Don't make me make it an order, Commander, or I'll have the doc take you down to sickbay and begin poking you with the biggest set of needles he has."
