        <h2>Chapter 10: Recovery</h2>

		<h3>INS Challenger</h3>
		<h3>Sickbay</h3>

		<p>
		It had been hours since Aayla began helping her two former comrades, using her own energies to bolster both Ahsoka's and Barris's own energy levels and help them through their physical recovery, but both were to her eyes unbalanced. They had been suffering for a long time and were perilously close to losing themselves to the darkness inside them that had been festering ever since they had been captured and forced into slavery.
		</p>
        <p>
		For Barris it was a much more dire situation for her. She had known suffering far longer than Ahsoka, ever since she was imprisoned roughly two years ago. Aayla caught a number of brief flashes of her life that flitted across the connection, and she was nearly sickened. No sentient being should have to endure such a horrible fate as had befallen this young woman. Ahsoka was a little luckier, having been able to hide herself for a while, but her luck eventually ran out and she too was now close to giving in to the darkness and surrender herself to her own hate and anguish.
		</p>
        <p>
		Eventually Aayla had to stop and rest herself. Channelling the Force into someone was taxing for most Jedi, but Aayla was doing it for two. She gently stopped the flow of Force energy and tiredly reclined back into the chair she had appropriated for a short nap.
		</p>
        <p>
		Suddenly a loud scream sounded from the bed on her left side. Barris had woken up and she was terrified. Her scream was as loud and shrill as a banshee and woke up Ahsoka and interrupted Aayla's catnap. Aayla quickly moved to her side and looked deep into her eyes.
		</p>
        <p>
		"It's alright Barris, you're safe now," she said soothingly, quickly put her hands on her shoulders and made Barris focus on her, yet she still screamed in terror. Ahsoka launched herself off her bed, nearly tearing out her medical IV, and landed right next to Aayla and pushed her out of Barris's line of sight.
		</p>
        <p>
		"We're safe Barris, remember? We were brought here for medical attention. No one here is going to hurt you!" said Ahsoka in the strongest voice she could muster, cradling Barris's face in her hands and looked directly into her eyes. Immediately Barris calmed down, though she still shivered in fright.
		</p>
        <p>
		"The master is gone?" Barris asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		"If you mean Csalas, he fled from battle yesterday and hasn't been seen since. You are free now, Barris. Csalas is no longer you're master!" said Aayla reassuringly and Barris visibly relaxed, but only slightly. Aayla caught the attention of one of the nurses and seconds later Doctor Magellan himself came walking in.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I was beginning to worry you wouldn't wake up for a moment there," said the good doctor as he began to check the readout on the electronic chart that hung at the foot of Barris's sickbay bed. "You'll be happy to know that your vitals have stabilized, but there are still small amounts of that chemical cocktail that Csalas gave you in your system. We also took the liberty of removing your collars, wrist and ankle braces, so you don't have to worry about random electric shocks anymore."
