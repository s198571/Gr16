		<h3>INS Challenger</h3>
		<h3>Sickbay</h3>

		<p>
		The atmosphere of the sickbay aboard the Challenger was relatively relaxed. No one was rushing around and no one was calling out in pain, and Aayla was basking in the momentary peace while Ahsoka and Barris snoozed more peacefully in their beds than they had earlier, and since she had first seen them she had not left their side except to go to the bathroom and the nurses had graciously brought up her meals from the mess hall.
        </p>
		<p>
		As she was eating her lunch she immediately sensed a very familiar presence approaching sickbay, and she felt that persons conflicted emotions swirling beneath a heavily controlled emotionless mask. She closed her dark hazel eyes and centred herself while still eating her lunch.
		</p>
        <p>
		Her new guest came into the sickbay and immediately spotted the closed off section and made a beeline for Aayla and her two fellow Jedi. "Welcome Commander Hess. What brings you to sickbay?" Aayla asked in the most serene and peaceful tone she could muster.
		</p>
		<p>
		Commander Hess snorted in amusement at her friend. "You always know who is coming without seeing them. How do you do that?"
		</p>
		<p>
		She merely rose her right eyebrow and opened up her right eye with an amused twinkle in it. "Do you really want me to answer that here?"
		</p>
		<p>
		"No," she answered shortly. " Kayla I need to talk to you in private."
		</p>
		<p>
		Aayla for a moment almost forgot her cover name, having spent so much time with her old friends. She nodded and followed Commander Hess out of the sickbay and into a corridor deep within the ship, far away from the damaged sections and away from any of the still active duty stations.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Kayla I have some good news and some bad news, which do you want to hear," Commander Hess asked, her nervousness broke slightly through her mask.
		</p>
		<p>
		"The bad news first I believe, that way I have something to look forward to," she answered.
		</p>
		<p>
		"The Admiral just informed us that the ISB has begun to put their agents aboard naval ships as political officers and advisors aboard every navy capital ship. Ours is scheduled to arrive in three weeks and there's something you should know. His name is Colonel Neraj Riskovat, and his reputation is not a good one. He made a name for himself exposing various officers who he felt were treasonous to both the Republic and the New Order after Order 66, and he is an unrepentant xenophobe, much like Commodore Delmar if you remember?"
		</p>
		<p>
		Aayla nodded in understanding. "So the fleet is getting some new watchdogs. What's going to happen to Barris and Ahsoka?"
		</p>
		<p>
		"They are going to be transferred to a medical frigate along with the other slaves, wounded and the dead which will take them to Corellia and then on to the Coronet Medical Academy for further treatment," Commander Hess said reassuringly.
		</p>
		<p>
		"I suppose this may also be an opportunity for them to possibly find out if any of the Corellian Jedi managed to escape the massacre, once they have healed," said Aayla thoughtfully. "You said you had some good news?"
		</p>
		<p>
		"I don't know if this is good news or not, but the admiral has asked the Commodore to be his representative to the Festival of Lights on Naboo," said Commander Hess, then became slightly nervous. "And he has chosen the two of us to be his designated guests at the festival."
		</p>
		<p>
		Both of Aayla's eyebrows rose all the way up her forehead in surprise. "Why both of us? Why not just one of us, or even just me?"
		</p>
		<p>
		"Most likely to give everyone the impression that he supports the emperor's human centric policies, and give you the opportunity to search for any Jedi that may be in hiding on Naboo," said Mirialia to Aayla's increasing surprise as her eyebrows rose ever higher, if possible. "It could also be because this may be the once in a lifetime opportunity for him to see the two of us in dresses together," she said coyly to Aayla's rapidly increasing embarrassment. "Which reminds me I don't really have anything to wear," said Mirialia with her own slight blush of embarrassment tingeing her cheeks.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Well then, I'll just have to remedy your situation," said Aayla warmly. "It will be a very pleasant surprise for Jack when he sees us, maybe we can even have a little fun with him," she continued as she slinked her right arm around Mirialia's waist as she smirked and thoroughly enjoyed the shocked and scandalized look upon her human friend's face, who decided to turn the tables on the twi'lek, by running her left hand along the sensitive portions of Aayla's lekku, which made her unconsciously moan in delight.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Jack's not the only one who appreciates a fine female specimen. Meet me in my quarters in four hours. I'll be off duty at that time and we can discuss what to wear for the commodore's pleasure," Mirialia whispered into her ear seductively and left the flustered twi'lek to go back on duty with a rare smile on her lips.
