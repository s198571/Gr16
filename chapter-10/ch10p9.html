		"Do we know when this white coat is scheduled to arrive?" Hal asked the admiral nervously, he didn't want this character anywhere near himself or his son.

		"We have three weeks until he takes his post aboard the Challenger, which I assume is enough time for you to complete the refit?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"More than enough time to do the repair work and reinstall the turrets that were destroyed in the battle," Mister Blissex answered quickly.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Well there is a small problem we want you to address," began Commander Hess. "During our last major engagement our CIWS guns almost overheated themselves into uselessness and missed more than sixty percent of their targets, mostly missiles, due to extremely effective electronic countermeasures employed by the pirates."
		</p>
        <p>
		Blissex had a quick thought about that. "The Separatists encountered almost the same amount of difficulty during the latter stages of the war and were forced to close the distance with Republic warships, that's why the Battle of Coruscant resembled more like a cantina brawl than a space engagement." He had Hal work his console and had him bring up a number of holos of various weapons, the one thing they all had in common was that they were all mass accelerator weaponry.

        <p>
		"One solution they utilized was to use an ancient, but surprisingly effective, principle into action. Flak guns. Explosive shells accelerated at the enemy fighters and missiles and detonated within close proximity of their targets." He nodded to Hal who worked his console again. The holos shown were of two different gun systems and a rotating Challenger. "I'm sure you recognise the standard 6 inch AV-8 mass accelerator cannon, which your ship carries thirty of. They can be armed with various types of shell, including flack, plasma, proton and ion shells. Excellent for long range interception. The other is the Bofors 40 millimetre gun. These fire a fairly cheap and effective 40 by 300 millimetre flak, proton or ion shells at 120 rounds per minute, mounted in quad mounts. These would provide a literal wall of fire and could be one of the most versatile weapon systems we've installed yet on the Challenger and give you a few more options," said Blissex with a slight smile upon his lips.

		All at the conference table were intrigued by the possibilities that these guns and their accompanying ammunition could provide.

		"These weapons could be a good alternative to ion cannons, which suffer from short range limitations," Commander Hess mused. "The ionic pulses generated this new type of ordinance should be plenty strong enough to render most droid fighters control systems permanently scrambled."
		</p>
        <p>
		"And the larger rounds of the 6 inch guns might be enough to put most small pirate ships out of action and help knock out the shields of larger vessels," said Jack with a smile. More prize money for me and my crew, he thought cunningly. "I assume that you can get all of this done quickly?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"It'll be close, but once we're finished with the Retribution we can move the droids and yard workers over to the Challenger and get the work done faster," said Hal as he quickly consulted his computer.

        <p>
		"While I have you all here Commodore I have another mission for you. I'm sure you've heard the rumours of there being Jedi on Naboo?" the admiral asked.
