		“Maybe next time, but remember, I’m not the raw cadet you once taught, my tolerance has certainly gone up as yours has dulled with age,” Jack fired back as he and his aide left the bar. As they were leaving through the exit one of Delmar’s captains stood in their way, a large and bulky man whom stood a good four inches above Jack’s six foot stature, and was heavily muscled.

        <p>
		“Move aside captain,” Jack ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Can’t do that sir,” replied.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Let me make something perfectly clear, that wasn’t a suggestion that was an order, captain,” said Jack as he stepped up to the much larger man.

        <p>
		“He won’t move without my express command, Hawks, unless you were to agree to share in your good fortune,” said Commodore Delmar in his pleasant, yet oily voice. “How about you give me that slave of yours for a few hours, I’m sure that she wouldn’t mind servicing five strong human males,” he continued as he mentally undressed Kayla with his eyes.

        <p>
		“I don’t share my property with anyone, much less you, we both find you repulsive and I don’t want your slimy hands all over her, now move aside captain before security arrives, barkeep, I assume the marines are on their way?”
		</p>
        <p>
		“Yes sir, they should be here in another thirty seconds.”
		</p>
        <p>
		“That’s how long you have before I have the marines throw you all into the brig, they are under the admiral’s authority, and that means you cannot order them around as easily as your own troops, so I suggest you move, now!” said Jack in a deadly calm voice. The captain glanced worriedly at his commodore. He got no help there, and since Commodore Hawks didn’t appear to be bluffing he decided to move aside, just in time to see a squad of station marines walk into a bar.

        <p>
		“We heard that there was a problem here,” said the squad leader.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Not anymore, just a small misunderstanding between folk, good day gentlemen,” said Jack as he and Kayla left the bar. “Let’s get back to the ship, before the urge to shoot Commodore Delmar becomes too tempting,” he continued as he looked around for a mouse droid. He spotted a dozen of them a little further down the corridor docked to their recharging ports. He picked out one which was programmed as a guide. “Droid, lead us back to hangar bay 44,” Jack ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		With a series of short beeps the little droid uncoupled from its docking station then lead them back to the hangar where their shuttle was waiting, boarded, then flew out of the hangar.
