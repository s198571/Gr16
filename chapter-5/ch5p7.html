		“I take it you both heard what happened on Kessel?” the admiral asked.

		“Mostly rumours and propaganda, we heard that Vader found and exterminated a nest of some fifty Jedi, but I don’t really put much stock into those rumours, I’ve seen Jedi fight, and I can tell you right now that fifty fully trained Jedi Knights would definitely be too much for Darth Vader to handle,” said Jack confidently.

		“It’s true, no single warrior, not even Anakin Skywalker, could best fifty Jedi in a head-on battle,” said Kayla, she knew that even with the Dark Side of the Force as his ally, no one warrior could best fifty.

		“You’d be correct, there were only eight Jedi, and it was a trap for him, and he didn’t come away from it entirely unscathed, at least that’s according to my agents aboard Darth Vader’s flagship,” said the admiral. “It appears that one of the Jedi managed to throw his lightsabre at him and compromised his helmet, and exposed one of his eyes.” The admiral pulled up an image on a nearby holo-monitor, displaying a still footage of Darth Vader, with his armour visibly damaged, various cuts and burns, and a piece of his helmet, that used to cover his right eye was missing.

		“The quality may not be the best, but it was enough for me to conduct a retinal identification scan,” said the admiral as he zoomed in on the sith lord’s exposed eye, and a retinal scan image of it took its place, filling half of the monitor, the other half with another retinal scan.

        <p>
		“The scan on the left belongs to our new sith lord, the other belongs to a rather famous jedi, now watch.” The two scans overlapped each other and lined up perfectly. “There is no mistake, that man is, or was, Anakin Skywalker!”

        <p>
		“WHAT?” shouted Kayla in shock, it couldn’t be, it was impossible. “That is not Skywalker, I knew him, I fought beside him on more than one occasion, he would never betray the Republic or the jedi,” she said vehemently.

        <p>
		“Retinal scans don’t lie Master Secura, that is Anakin Skywalker, or at least his body, we don’t know what Palpatine did to him to change him like this, one of the few who may know is Jedi Master Yoda.”

		“I heard that the emperor has put up a large bounty on the old Grand Master, fifty million credits for his head, dead or alive, preferably alive,” said Jack. “I say good luck to any bounty hunter that tries to take that jedi’s head; I saw some battle footage of what he was capable of from the Battle of Coruscant.”

        <p>
		“Well, he is the only known surviving jedi that might know what happened to him, I believe we would all like to have the answer to that question,” replied the admiral just before he took another sip of his brandy, with Jack following suit. “Regarding your battle group Jack, I am reinforcing it with more ships.” The admiral called up a list of ship names on the holo-monitor, cancelling out the image of the retina scans.
