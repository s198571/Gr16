        <h2>Chapter 5: Joining the Fleet</h2>
                <p>
                Bespin, a gas giant that was also the namesake for the Bespin-type gas giants
				that populated the galaxy, the rare ones that contained a life-zone in the upper regions
				of their atmospheres, it was also well known as being a big exporter of refined tibanna gas,
				a necessary component in weaponry and hyperdrive cores. Today the planet was hosting a large fleet
				of Imperial warships, ranging in size from the massive new Imperial star destroyers
				to the smaller Corellian corvette escorts, grouped together in small battle groups,
				though for each battle group there were no more than one Imperial class star destroyer,
				and there were only four battle groups that had such powerful vessels as their flagships.

                <p>
                Several light minutes out nine ships came out of hyperspace, the first were six
				modified Corellian corvettes then a pair of Acclamator IIIs, the Dauntless and Endurance,
				and finally the battle group’s flagship, the Challenger, the prototype for the Challenger class,
				and built to the same size as the Imperial class, which made her the biggest carrier/battle-cruiser
				hybrid vessel in her size category in the entire Imperial Navy. She was also one of the most heavily
				armed vessels in orbit, with an obvious ability to easily exchange broadsides with an
				Imperial class star destroyer all day long.

                <p>
				On the command bridge of the Challenger Commodore Jack Hawks waited for the summons from
				his new commanding officer. In the meantime he just took in the sight of what were the makings
				of the current Anti-Piracy Fleet of the Imperial Navy. Alongside him stood his XO constantly
				barking out orders to the command crew and maintaining a firm and terrifying grip on the reins of command.

				“Helm, watch out for the Blood Sun, she’s almost on top of us,” she reminded the helmsmen and navigators.
				The Blood Sun was a Victory class star destroyer, a vessel that had been designed and built at
				the same time as the Venator, but in greater numbers due to its simpler construction.
				The Challenger manoeuvred underneath her and cleared her hull by several meters.

                <p>
				“What the hell was that ship doing outside of formation?” the XO asked one of the comm. officers.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Sir, the Blood Sun was ordered to block and challenge any vessel coming out of hyperspace
				by its battle group commander.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Who?” she demanded in a cold voice that sent chills down the spines of everyone on the bridge,
				including the Commodore.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Commodore Tyko Delmar of the Triumph, ma’am,” he answered with no sign of fear,
				he was used to the XO’s icy disposition.
