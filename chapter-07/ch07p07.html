		"Don't worry so much, it'll ruin your new face," said Jack in an attempt to lighten the mood, and funnily enough it worked, as Kayla's worried frown burst into a short laugh. "Like my mother always said, laughter is always better than pills for whatever ails you," said Jack as he opened up his uniform jacket and tiredly moved over to his desk deeper into his quarters, a simple dark wood desk with a highly polished sheen to it, which for most officers would cost a small fortune to buy and have installed, though in Jack's case it was a simple deal for his father to procure one. With a sigh he sat himself down into his comfortable leather bound office chair and began reading the day's status reports. As he read the reports Kayla came over and began to massage the aches and pains in his shoulders.

		"By the Force I don't think I have encountered someone with so many knots in his shoulders," she said as she persistently and quite forcibly worked the many knots in his shoulder and back muscles.
		</p>
		<p>
		"You have no idea how good this feels Kayla," said Jack as he reclined further back in his comfy chair.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Well, you deserve it, both as a thank you for saving my life, as well as for all your hard work in getting your ship and crew in order," she said as she continued to massage him.
		</p>
		<p>
		"I may have been the one who saved you, but I don't really deserve such praise, or this sort of treatment from you," said Jack as he gently took hold of her hands and took them off his shoulders, then continued to read his reports, though she immediately saw him tense up once again as he practically hunched over his desk.
		</p>
		<p>
		"You need to relax, all this stress is not good for you."
		</p>
		<p>
		"It's not easy to relax when I'm personally responsible for several thousand men and women aboard these ships, plus the fact that I'm trying to avoid attention from the Imperial Security Bureau, and if this mission pans out I'll probably come under greater scrutiny from the White Coats, mainly to ensure my loyalty to the Emperor." All he could do is snort at that comment. "Hell, they are the worst that humanity has to offer, and don't think I can't see the problems they are going to cause down the road. They will cause more uprisings and rebellions than they put down, and mark my words, the non-human races of this galaxy will be the ones that will suffer the most, and when the Empire falls, like all empires that are built upon slaughter deceit will, the aliens that were oppressed will no doubt turn their anger upon the rest of us."

		"You really must relax Jack, all those worries are for the future, further down the path, and we must face them one at a time and solve them. Now I say it is time for you to head for bed. It is now twenty three hundred hours and you need rest, and you will do your crew no favours by arriving on duty half asleep," said Kayla sternly.
		</p>
		<p>
		"But Kayla I really need to review these reports..."
		</p>
		<p>
		"But nothing, Mirialia isn't the only one on this ship who works oneself into the grave, now off to bed!"
		</p>
		<p>
		All Jack could offer was a half sarcastic reply of, "Yes dear," then trotted off for his bunk, slowly disrobing himself and headed for his fresher unit to do his night routine for bed, and Kayla, acting as the ever loyal servant girl, helped him.
