		After thirty more seconds they finally burned through the armoured inner hull then a second set of shaped charges blew away the heavy slab of armour they had cut into the corridor they had managed to breach into, catching an entire platoon of B1s who had been passing by and waiting for the clones to come in, only to be caught by the instantly fragmented piece of armour and destroyed the majority of them. The golden marked command droid called over the radio.

        <p>
		"Uh, Captain Sir, our hull has been breached," it reported nervously.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Then get a damage control party there to plug it!" Captain Csalas ordered irritably.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Yes sir, but there are imperial troops coming through the breach, we need reinforcements, ah," It was cut short by flurry of rapidly firing blaster bolts.
		</p>
        <p>
		The clones came running out and took up positions to secure the initial breach as the rest came out, scanning the currently only temporarily safe patch of enemy territory. Commander Max came out last and took point with his ARC Troopers. He turned back towards the assault shuttle and saw that the last of their boarding party, a pair of R3 units, come aboard. One was white with red trim, the other was black with silver trim, and both had transparent domes. Four marines were charged with protecting them as the boarding party fought its way to the bridge.

        <p>
		"Everyone magnetize your boots! Assault shuttle, boarding party is aboard. You can disengage from the hull now and return to the ship," Commander Max ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		The shuttle's pilot acknowledged and then broke the seal as it pulled away, exposing the interior of the ship to the vacuum of space, which momentarily pulled at the boarding party, but before the compartment could depressurise atmospheric ray shields came online around the breach. A very surprising safety feature the clones hadn't seen that often. Something I will have to recommend we get installed in our ships.

        <p>
		The clones moved forward at a rapid pace, gunning down every enemy droid they came across as they made a beeline for the ship's bridge.

		<h3>Merchants Terror</h3>
		<h3>Command Bridge</h3>

		<p>
		Csalas felt true fear in that moment when he heard the brief report from one of his B1 platoon commanders before it was cut off. He hadn't faced clones himself in close quarters in years, and he knew he was seriously out of shape for it.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Tactical droid, call in the rapid reaction force. Stop those clones from getting up to the bridge," and protect me.
		</p>
        <p>
		"By your command!" it responded then sent out the orders via the ship's intercom system. From holding racks at specific points across the ship BX-series commando droids and droidekas began rolling to their designated chokepoints. Csalas took a quick look at the tactical display and was horrified to discover that clones had boarded his two Lucrehulks and were soon about to be taken. He quickly checked the internal cameras and watched the clones fight the hoards of droids he sent against them and watched as they quickly and efficiently brought them down. His eyes twitched in barely controlled rage. They should not be able to take all of my droids down. Not without suffering casualties, and yet I see none. These are veterans that much I can tell.
