        <h3>INS Challenger</h3>
		<h3>Command Bridge</h3>

		<p>
		On the command bridge things were settling down as the last of the enemy guns and fighters fell silent at last, and the Commodore and the rest of the crew could finally breathe a sigh of relief. Now came the aftermath.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Commander Hess, start putting together a full damage report for the entire battle group. Let's find out how badly we've been hurt today," he ordered tiredly as he stepped away from the tactical holo-tank. "I'll be heading down to the medical bay. I need to have a little talk with Doctor Magellan."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Aye sir, I'll bring the report to you when it's finished," Commander Hess said reassuringly. "Sir, all things considered it could have been worse."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Doesn't really help me sleep at night!" said the Commodore so quietly as he got into the turbolift, Commander Hess had to struggle to hear what he just said, and was just happy that none of the crew had been able to hear him. Morale was low enough as it was.
		</p>
        <p>
		As he rode down in the turbolift he took the opportunity of privacy the turbolift car gave him to drop the stony mask he was forced to don in front of his crew and for a few moments let the emotions come cleanly upon his face, but he never cried, nothing dramatic, just letting the emotions come to the surface and deal with them in private, attempting to resolve his emotions in the few minutes he had, but the journey down was over quickly and he quickly donned the stony mask once again and headed straight for the ship's sickbay.
		</p>
        <p>
		The sickbay was a hive of barely controlled chaos as doctors and nurses were working hard to save all of the wounded they have, and in the middle of this chaotic circus act was its master conductor, overseeing the treatment of all of his patients and helping wherever he was needed.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Alright, third degree burns across twenty percent of his body and second degree burns across another forty percent put this patient into the bacta tanks in ward 3. Next!" said the good Doctor Magellan as the patient was removed and he moved over to the next.
		</p>
        <p>
		The Commodore smiled at the doctor's usual gruff bedside manner then moved in closer. "Hello doctor, what's the butcher's bill?" he asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		The Doctor stopped for a moment, then continued towards his next patient, a crewman with a few nasty blaster wounds in his left shoulder, chest and left leg and was being held down by a couple of pretty nurses since he was thrashing around on the bed. "One second Commodore," said the Doctor as he took out a syringe with a clear liquid in it and stuck it quickly into the clearest vein and injected the cocktail of sedatives into the patient and soon enough he was calmed down. "Clean out those wounds quickly before they get infected and put some bacta patches on them," he ordered shortly and the nurses began carrying out his orders.
		</p>
        <p>
		"It's a real mess down here Jack. So far I have seventy five dead in my morgue and more than three hundred wounded in my beds so far. Most of the dead are the result of those commando droids that boarded us, decapitations, blaster wounds, vibro-sword cuts, some of these wounds I thought I wouldn't be treating again anytime soon," said the doctor as he led the Commodore to his office. It was small with only a medical cabinet and desk with a single comfy office chair and two slightly less comfy chairs situated in front of the desk.
