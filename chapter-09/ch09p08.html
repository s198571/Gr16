		"Well this pirate is one tricky bastard. Six months of hunting him, nothing but hit and run attacks which we interrupt and never catch any of his ships, and then he comes after us with a large and powerful fleet. We seriously pissed him off and promptly kicked his ass, and just when we had him cornered and even boarded his ship he escapes my clutches," said the Commodore in exasperation.

        <p>
		"Well, it seems that both sides didn't get what they wanted. You may have beaten his fleet, but he still escaped. How many times has this battle group saved a convoy?" the doctor asked curiously.
		</p>
        <p>
		"The past six months we've stopped roughly a hundred attacks and in the last two engagements we destroyed his two interdictor modified cruisers, then goes silent for a couple of weeks, then this massive simultaneous attack on ten different convoys. I must have seriously pissed him off, because he sent half of his whole damned fleet after us."

		"You should be flattered. That means he respects you," said the doctor as he brought up a flask of Corellian Brandy. "Twenty years old this thing is, I hope you appreciate what I'm treating you with," he said as he poured a good finger's width of brandy into a pair of tumblers.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Doc, I'm still on duty!" said Jack with little conviction.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Yeah, and I'm your doctor and I say you need this!" the older man said as he pushed the tumbler towards him.
		</p>
        <p>
		With reluctance Jack took the tumbler gingerly in his hand and sipped at the brandy, the scent was heady and wooden, and the drink warmed his mouth, throat and belly as it travelled and settled, relaxing him, and he hated it. The drink numbed his senses and slowed his reaction times, though he would admit small doses now and then were sometimes required.

        <p>
		"You know Jack, I've been a medic and a doctor in the service of the navy for almost thirty years, and I've known all types of men, and they all dealt with grief and stress in their own way. Yes, men have been lost, but know that your cause has been just and their sacrifice necessary."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Hmph, I know, but it still doesn't really dull the pain," countered Jack.
		</p>
        <p>
		The good doctor smiled sadly. "No, but it does make it slightly bearable, and enables you to live with it."
		</p>
        <p>
		"But what if the man you have sworn to serve..."
		</p>
        <p>
		"No, you do not serve Him," said Doctor Magellan in distaste. "Your oath of service is to the people of our native Corellia, her colonies and her allies. We just rent our services to Emperor Palpatine's Imperial Navy. We have no loyalty to him. You and I both know his reign is built upon terror and death, and such an empire cannot stand for ever. Sooner or later there is going to be another war, and that war won't be as cut and dry as the Clone Wars."
		</p>
        <p>
		Jack emptied his tumbler in one short gulp then stood up. "Well, thank you doctor for the talk, but I need to return to duty."
		</p>
        <p>
		"And so do I, my doctors and pretty nurses would most likely fall apart without me if I do not supervise them," said Doctor Magellan well naturedly.
		</p>
        <p>
		Jack could only crack a small smile at the good doctor's comment then headed back up to the command bridge.
