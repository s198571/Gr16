        <h2>Chapter 9: Humbling the Pirate King</h2>

		<h3>INS Challenger</h3>
		<h3>Command Bridge</h3>

		<p>
		On the Command Bridge it was controlled chaos as reports came in and the tactical officers were barely able to process the information coming in from the various ships and fighters that were fighting. It was into this barely controlled chaos that Commander Max stepped into and was barely able to comprehend it. He was a Special Forces operative, not a fleet commander. He quickly spotted the Commodore standing at the tactical holo-tank in the CIC behind the Command Bridge.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Max, make it quick," the Commodore snapped out, which nearly startled the seasoned ARC trooper. He hadn't even turned around to face him from his study of the holo-tank.
		</p>
        <p>
		"We cornered the last of the Commando droids in one of the ship's laundry rooms. The enemy droid presence has been purged."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Very good Commander, assemble your men for boarding operations. I want you to take control of Csalas' capital ships, and I want you to personally lead the mission to capture the Merchants Terror, and if you or your men see him, your orders are to terminate, with extreme prejudice, am I clear," the Commodore ordered, with absolutely no room for misinterpretation.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Crystal clear, sir," Commander Max responded with a snap salute and began marching towards the nearest turbolift. Along the way he asked a crewman, "What's happened to make the Commodore give such an order?"
		</p>
        <p>
		The young crewman grew nervous as he glanced towards the Commodore. "The Surprise was destroyed a few minutes ago, just after saving this ship from a few kamikaze light freighters. She survived the kamikazes, but the Merchants Terror destroyed her with a turbolaser barrage, and even targeted a few of the Surprise's escape pods. As you can tell, the Commodore is pissed off, to put it mildly."
		</p>
        <p>
		Commander Max's eyes widened in understanding, "Thank you, crewman?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"Daniels, sir."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Crewman Daniels, Carry on." Max continued to the turbolift and took it down to the ship's barracks, where his platoon of ARC Troopers and Clone Marines were currently billeted. He quickly arrived to the sight of several ARC Troopers and marines checking their weaponry and armour for damage.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Hey Commander, we got another mission?" his second asked, ARC Captain Digger, or CT-2199 as he is officially registered.
		</p>
        <p>
		"We just got the job of boarding and taking over three former Separatist warships. So buckle up your armour and load up your blasters boys, we're going hunting," Max said with a shit eating grin, which was mirrored by the other ARC Troopers in his squad, but the marines were a little more subdued.
