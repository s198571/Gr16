		“We’re now at optimal range,” Commander Hess reported.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Fire!”
		</p>
        <p>
		In an instant four bright blue beams of energy erupted from the three ships,
		two from the Challenger and one from each of the Acclamator IIIs.
		The two beams from the Challenger converged upon the Lucrehulk battleship,
		piercing the shields and destroyed its bridge, taking out the droids command and control.
		At the same time the Dauntless and Endurance each fired upon a frigate, their powerful
		beams cut straight through their shields and cored through them from bow to stern,
		setting off secondary explosions which began in the engineering section and blossomed out forwards,
		consuming both droid vessels.

		“Helm, change course twenty degrees to starboard, port gunners standby to
		give that ship a full broadside of all portside main gun batteries,” the Commodore ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Aye sir, changing course,” reported the helmsman.
		</p>
        <p>
		The Challenger began turning, showing off its profile to the crippled Lucrehulk.
		As soon as the Challenger turned twenty degrees her portside gun batteries opened up,
		each battery had four turbolaser turrets, and each turret had three cannons.
		They fired at full power, unleashing a dozen megatons of energy with each shot,
		and each cannon fired three shots per second, the space between the two ships quickly
		became filled with a firestorm of blue energy, quickly tearing down the remaining shields
		of the Lucrehulk then blasted at the ship’s armoured hull until it failed,
		massive explosions rippled across the hull as the Challenger continued to
		relentlessly destroy its target until one could see the inner workings of the ship.

		“Commodore I suggest you cease fire, I think you’ve neutralized those ships,” said Jack’s father
		as he watched a ten million credit investment get ripped apart.
		</p>
        <p>
		Jack merely nodded and said, “All gunners cease fire, all weapons safe.”
		</p>
        <p>
		The batteries ceased fire instantly and went to idle.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Damage report, Commander?”
		</p>
        <p>
		“No major damage among the battle group, a few strained shield generators on the corvettes,
		but nothing crippling and all ships report fully combat capable despite the
		overzealousness of our droid opponents,” Commander Hess responded.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Very good, Mister Hawks if you would join me in the CIC, you too Mister Blissex,” said Jack
		intensely as he rose up from his command chair, a personal touch he had done even
		before the Challenger was upgraded, he didn’t see why he had to keep
		standing all the time on the bridge. He ordered the CIC cleared, not wanting any witnesses
		to the ass chewing he was about to give these two.
