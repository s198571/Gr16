		Next to come out was Mirialia. In stark contrast to Kayla she wore a slinky black dress that emphasized her own athletic physique. It seemed to loop around her neck, expose a generous amount of cleavage and left her back completely exposed down to the small of her back. There was a slit that went along her side from her waist and as she walked she enticingly exposed her legs, just for brief flashes, but it was enough to get Jack's blood hotter. She also wore black high heeled shoes, and to Jack's surprise she seemed just as comfortable in them as she was in normal boots or shoes.

		Both females took in the look in Jack's eyes and saw that they had both achieved their objective. Turn Jack into a drooling idiot at the sight of them.

		"Like what you see, Commodore?" Mirialia asked impishly, just as both she and Kayla stood closer together and linked their arms together, contrasting with each other, yet still they were the same. A pair of attractive ladies, and Jack was tongue tied.

		He finally shook himself out of his stupor. "Ladies, if I didn't know any better I'd say the pair of you were goddesses."

        <p>
		Both women smiled and both linked their arms with his. Kayla on his left and Mirialia on his right, and he led them down to the palace courtyard where the rest of the guests were congregating, all wearing their best outfits. All three of them enjoyed the last few rays of sunshine as the sun set and the sky began to turn blood red, which slowly faded over the next half hour into dark blue and the stars began to shine and the local nebula became visible which combined with the few clouds in the sky to create some interesting shapes in the night sky.

		A floodlight suddenly flashed into existence and illuminated a nearby balcony and the young Queen Apailana stepped into the light, resplendent in a ceremonial red dress, her face a powdered white with dark red lips, standing serene and proud as she looked out upon her guests.

		"Welcome to the opening of the Festival of Light. It has now been eight-hundred-and-fifty years since we first joined the Republic, and two-and-a-half years since the end of the Clone Wars and the beginning of the New Order. May it last forever," she concluded with her arms raised and outstretched with bilious robes extended from her arms down to her legs like wings and the fireworks began.

        <p>
		Small rockets flew high into the air, leaving behind thin trails of multi-coloured sparks then exploded, lighting up the sky with small shockwaves of reds, blues and gold. Several silver rockets flew up then separated into many more smaller silver darts that drew pictures of various native animals, from aiwhas to sando aqua monsters, while still more multi-coloured rockets continued to rise up to splash more colours in the sky.

        <p>
		As the grand finale a massive red rocket rose up from behind the palace. Suddenly it began to come apart. First the nose cone split open like blooming flower, revealing a krayt dragon's head, then the main cylinder broke up and fell away, disappearing in showers of red sparks that fell harmlessly upon the guests, and revealed a huge red krayt dragon with skeletal wings that extended from its back and spread wide. It banked almost lazily to the left then began to dive towards the courtyard. Everyone, but the queen and the few military officers in the crowd, became nervous as it dove towards them, and several of the guests began to flee before it. The dragon flew only a few feet above everyone's heads, and everyone either ducked or dove instinctively to avoid it, and the queen smiled mischievously in mirth as she watched the politicians dive for cover in fright.
