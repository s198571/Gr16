		"You are an interesting man, commodore. Not only do you associate with Jedi, you're also harbouring one. This could be more profitable than I ever could have imagined," Cad Bane mused to himself, but then remembered, "but then that would also mean abandoning the bounty on your head which clearly states they want you terminated, and that could leave a stain on my otherwise perfect record."

		Seconds later the voices of his three targets vanished, most likely a servant had taken their glasses and now he was only hearing the constant background chatter of the other guests. He turned off his listening devices, which immediately fried the micro-circuitry in them and turned them into useless films of plastic, and began to study the layout of the palace, also procured by his employer, but he still needed to find out where the Commodore and his companions were staying.

		<h3>Naboo</h3>

		Former Jedi Master Quinlan Vos was racing through the forest, dodging past various trees and animals, both small and large, on foot, using the Force to boost his speed. He was racing against the chronometer, he needed to get to the staging area before it was too late. He had to convince the gungans and his fellow Jedi not to attack the local imperial garrison. Finally he reached the staging area, a wide open clearing in the middle of the swamp, where he could see several squads worth of gungans and a small group of four Jedi in robes and armour. A human, an iridonian and a pair of twi'leks, a male and female .

		He soon spotted the one responsible for this little gathering. "Knight Finn Shysanar, we need to talk!" he said quickly with no room for argument in his tone.
		</p>
        <p>
		The younger man looked at the older kiffar in a slightly annoyed mood, but followed him off to the north side of the clearing, out of earshot from both the Jedi and the gungans.
		</p>
        <p>
		"This better be good, Master Vos, we're just about to commence our attack on the garrison and their power generator!"
		</p>
        <p>
		"Listen to me young man, Imperial Intelligence already knows we're here on this planet. The only reason Vader and his 501st has not come down on us is because of our hidden allies in Imperial Intelligence is keeping the information from him and his emperor, but that can't last forever. We have to leave now, while we still have a chance!"
		</p>
        <p>
		"We can't, we are committed to this. We must show the galaxy that we are still here and we are willing to fight!" Knight Shysanar retorted harshly.
		</p>
        <p>
		"And risk all of these people's lives and the life of the Naboo queen, just for revenge?" Master Vos asked harshly.
		</p>
        <p>
		"It's not revenge, it's justice! They destroyed the Order. Our home. The only home I have ever known, and the clones, Vader and Palpatine are the ones responsible for all of this," Shysanar shouted, not knowing that his voice was carrying and attracted the attention of the gungan general and the other Jedi.
		</p>
        <p>
		"What's going on here?" the iridonian Jedi asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Nothing is going on, Mekat! Go back to the others," said Shysanar in a strained voice.
