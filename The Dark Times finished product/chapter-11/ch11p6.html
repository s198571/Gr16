		Aayla's face took on a horrified expression. "But that's not the Jedi way. Why are they doing this?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"They are angry and not thinking straight. They cannot see the possible consequences of their actions. They have been hurt and they feel the need to hurt the Empire in any way they can, to show the galaxy that the emperor's war machine is not invincible. I myself am against such action, but the angriest of us have the loudest voices and seem to have the ear of both the queen and the gungan bosses."
		</p>
        <p>
		"This is not good. I need to tell Jack," she said as the last waltz began to die down and the dancers slowed to a stop. She quickly curtsied to her former master and left him, making a beeline for Jack.
		</p>
        <p>
		She could see him smiling with Commander Hess who was heading for the buffet table for some reason. Aayla quickly reached Jack's side just before the next slow-dance was about to begin. Seeing Aayla coming towards him with a very serious look upon her face he quickly reached her side and as the music began again they danced, with Aayla hugging close to his body, almost grinding into him.
		</p>
        <p>
		"We have a serious problem on our hands!" she said quietly into Jack's ear.
		</p>
        <p>
		"What is it?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that I found my former master, Quinlan Vos. The bad news is that several of the Jedi in hiding here have convinced the queen that military action is required to get rid of the empire at this time."
		</p>
        <p>
		Jack had the same look in his eyes as Aayla had in hers. "This is bad. If they move now the empire will just send in Vader and the 501st to crush them before they can free this world. We need time to prepare a real rebellion. Not this haphazard half measure this surely will turn out to be."
		</p>
        <p>
		"I agree, but how do we approach the queen without looking suspicious?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"We don't. She will approach me. By tradition the queen dances with all of the highest ranked people at any ball. As a representative of Admiral Rod it will soon be my turn. She has just finished a dance with the governor, now it's the emperor's representative's turn, after that I will no doubt get my chance," said Jack confidently.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Be careful Jack. She may not receive you well, seeing as you've brought along a slave with you to the ball," Aayla cautioned.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Don't worry, I can handle the young queen, you just keep your senses on alert, and it's good that you and your former master are reunited again," he said smiling as the waltz came to an end and another began. Mirialia had just returned to Jack's side as the queen gracefully approached the Commodore.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Commodore Hawks, I see that your reputation is well deserved," she said in greeting to both him and his two companions.
		</p>
        <p>
		"And what reputation would that be, if I may ask your highness," he said with a gracious bow of the head. His first impression of her was that she was short, seeing as the queen's head barely reached his chest.
