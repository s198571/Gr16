        <h2>Chapter 11: Royal Entanglements</h2>

		<h3>Naboo, one week later</h3>
		<p>
		The space surrounding the planet Naboo was tranquil and relatively peaceful, except for a number of Golan III defence platforms and the relatively few ships that were entering and exiting the atmosphere. In a high parking orbit the Tector-class star destroyer INS Retribution stood vigil over the planet and launched a single Lambda-class personnel shuttle from its small starboard hangar bay. In addition to its two person crew there were two passengers and one piece of 'property' along with their luggage.

        <p>
		Commodore Jack Hawks lounged in his seat as the shuttle made its entry, almost nodding off since he had gone through such atmospheric entries plenty of times before, it had now become routine for him. With him was Commander Mirialia Hess, and she was not anywhere near as laid back as Jack was, still sitting at rigid attention and concentrating on a set of manuals she had downloaded to her personal data-pad. The last member of their group, and publically known as Jack's property, was Kayla Macula, also known as Aayla Secura, sat in between the two officers and was leaning on Jack, softly caressing his right arm as her right foot played a little with Mirialia's leg, which had caused her to stiffen and try to ignore the attractive blue skinned twi'lek's teasing actions.

        <p>
		"Have you been to Naboo before, Commodore," the commander asked in a slightly higher pitched tone than usual, to both Jack's and Kayla's bemusement.

        <p>
		"Once a couple of decades ago, just a few months after the Trade Federation Occupation ended. My dad was doing some contract work for CEC on Naboo; they were upgrading their military forces. Me and my mom tagged along and spent most of the three months that we were there helping out wherever we could. My dad somehow arranged for me to meet the queen at that time, Padme Amidala, as a small treat." He chuckled a little. "Imagine me as a wide eyed teenager from Corellia actually meeting royalty."
		</p>
        <p>
		"And now you're going to meet another and this time you're a military officer," said Mirialia as she relaxed a little and even started to enjoy the attention Kayla was giving to her leg, but it was soon cut short as the pilots announced that they had begun the landing cycle.

        <p>
		The shuttle travelled gracefully through the atmosphere and made its approach to Theed Spaceport. The spaceport was a typical Naboo structure, intricate stonework blending seamlessly with the natural environment. The shuttle touched down softly and the three passengers immediately felt the pleasant warmth of the local sun caress their faces as they felt a gentle breeze whisper past, cooling them as a human in Naboo servant's attire approached them.

        <p>
		"Welcome to Naboo, Commodore Hawks, I am Dell Garner, I have been assigned as your butler for the duration of your stay," he announced as he bowed respectfully to his charges. "If you would follow me please I will take you to your lodgings." He snapped his fingers and a number of servant droids began to take their recently offloaded luggage. The three new arrivals followed their butler to a speeder, a local model that spoke of the Naboo sense of style and environmentally sound technologies that they were renowned for. They sped off towards the centre of the capital Theed and took in its beauty. The palace itself seemed to dominate the city, yet still blended in with nature successfully.
