		<h3>Theed Palace</h3>
		<h3>Guest Wing</h3>
		<h3>Several hours later</h3>
		<p>
		All was quiet this night, but there was still an atmosphere of foreboding, as if a great sword was dangling above the palace and everyone in it, and Jack felt it most acutely. He was physically exhausted, but there would be no sleep for him this night as he waited for the sound of explosions, though he hoped that Master Vos would be successful. Both he and his companions had retired to their respective suites to rest, but he knew that both Aayla and Mirialia wouldn't be able to sleep anymore than he did.
		</p>
        <p>
		He lay there in bed, eyes staring up at the ceiling, hoping that simple exhaustion would allow him the sleep he so desperately wanted and needed, yet no matter what he did, from simply counting sheep to trying a few of Aayla's meditation exercises, nothing seemed to make him go to sleep.
		</p>
        <p>
		Unbeknownst to him a small mouse droid was watching him from a small air-vent in the wall opposite his bed, its multiple cameras zoomed in and recorded everything then transmitted the recording to its master. It then trundled along to the next suite and discovered his master's secondary targets, took a few pictures, transmitted them and stayed there. Kayla was meditating on the bed in a simple silk bra and panties while Mirialia was pacing the room in her own nightwear, a simple Imperial Navy issue black female's sports bra and panties.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Have you considered meditation to calm your nerves?" Kayla asked, finally having enough of the anxious human's pacing.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I don't have the patience for meditation, plus I never seem to have the time," said Mirialia hotly as she continued pacing. "I prefer to exercise before bed, but I can't exactly do that here beyond the basics," she said annoyed as she continued to pace the room.
		</p>
        <p>
		Kayla merely smiled serenely. "I had much the same trouble in the beginning of my training. I didn't want to just sit around contemplating the Force all day. I wanted adventure, excitement, and all the things a youngster craves. Of course in time I realized that sometimes you need to just sit down and catch your breath let your mind wander and let go of everything, for a little while. I can help you," she offered.
		</p>
        <p>
		"No thanks," Mirialia rebuffed. "I just can't stop thinking about what might have happened tonight. There are no explosions yet, and the queen told Jack that the attack was going to start two hours from then. It's now been a little over four hours since."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Then our mission has been accomplished. We have averted a potential disaster here on this planet, we now have a two week vacation, and I noticed that you just called your commanding officer by his first name," she ended mischievously.
		</p>
        <p>
		"No I didn't," Mirialia quickly denied.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Oh yes you did!"
		</p>
        <p>
		"No I did not!" she denied again vehemently.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Mirialia I heard you say his first name clear as day just seconds ago. There is no use in denying it!" Kayla told the still in denial commander.
