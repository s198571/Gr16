		“What kind of officer is he, and I don’t mean his extra-curricular activities, what kind of a ship handler is he?” Jack asked.
		</p>
		<p>
		“Why do you want to know?”
		</p>
		<p>
		“Because I’ve got a feeling that someday him and me are going to be on opposite sides in another galactic war, and when it breaks out I need to know my enemy. He will no doubt be one of many who might be sent against us.”
		</p>
		<p>
		“He is a competent ship-handler however he is prone to bouts of instability, especially during combat. He gets easily stressed when his battle-plans fall apart and that leads him to make rash decisions, though he is a sneaky bastard, willing to sell his own mother to the Hutts for the right price.” she said as she remembered some of the shipboard gossip she heard while under Delmar's command.

		"Would he try to set us up for any kind of slight to his ego?" Kayla asked.
		</p>
		<p>
		"In a Coruscant minute, the man is a sadist as well as extremely vindictive, he blacklisted me after all, but if it had happened after Order 66 I could just see him do more than that, he would no doubt have his ship's stormtroopers hold me down while he..." Her voice hitched as she considered the possibilities of what could have happened, and promptly buried them. "I'm sorry sir, even after all this time it's still difficult to talk about. Why do you ask?"
		</p>
		<p>
		"Because Delmar tried to bully me into giving him an opportunity to give himself and his cronies a 'test run' with Kayla and I said no, think that damaged his precious ego?" Jack rhetorically asked, already knowing the answer.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Well, if he didn't like you before, he positively hates you now!" said Mirialia, and not with a little trepidation. "He probably thought you didn't let anybody do any harm to your human crew, which he would respect, but that you protected an alien 'slave' from him, that would just not sit right with him. He believes most species, particularly twi'leks, should be used as slaves, and females for the pleasure of their human masters. The man's very presence is enough to make me sick."
		</p>
		<p>
		"Well, we'll just have to deal with him when the time comes," said Jack as both he and Kayla observed Mirialia visibly relax as the subject came to an end. There was definitely something more to her story, but for now they would let it go.
		</p>
		<p>
		"What did you think of our performance against the Concordia battle group?" said Jack, knowing she needed to focus on something else now.
		</p>
		<p>
		She relaxed even more, a small smile appeared on her lips and a little colour came back to her face. "Their performance was good, but they could still be better. I suggest more training drills, at least four times a week, and random scramble drills at least once or twice a week for a little variety. Our fighter squadrons were exceptional and was the most decisive for our little victory, but they too should be part of the drills, especially with the new ships coming in."
