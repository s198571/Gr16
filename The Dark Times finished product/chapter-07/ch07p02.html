		“On the day before we were to attack a Separatist forward military base on Tibrin he requested my presence in his quarters, supposedly to get my opinion on the mission. At the time I hadn’t seen or heard much about him, so I didn’t know what I was walking into. It started as a regular meeting, but over time he became flirtatious, and as time went on his advances became more insistent. Finally I had to put my foot down and told him flat out no, and made to leave his quarters. The next thing I knew he grabbed me before his door and began dragging me towards his bunk. He said, ‘You and every other whore on this ship are mine to do with as I please, and I will have you.’ After that I snapped,” she said and elaborated after seeing the confused looks of both the Commodore and Kayla. “I used my CQC training to throw him off of me to the deck and made sure the bastard could never reproduce.” She smiled in evil satisfaction of that memory. She clarified. “I was wearing my steel-toed boots at the time.”

		Jack gave an involuntary wince at what happened to Delmar and almost felt sorry for him. Almost being the most apt description of what he thought of the bastard commodore, but of what he had seen in the Bespin officers club, he didn’t think the man deserved any sympathy or pity at all.

		“Well your former commanding officer certainly knows you’re aboard this ship as my xo, and he’s just as much of a horn-dog as he was back then.”
		</p>

		“Why doesn’t anyone put a stop to him?” Commander Hess asked in exasperation.
		</p>
		<p>
		“The man has so many connections it’s impossible to get a full tally on them, mostly in the Imperial Senate and a few high level admirals. He’s probably got some dirt on them that he keeps over their collective heads,” said Jack in disgust, whishing that he could send in a squad of Commander Max’s ARC Troopers to personally take care of the bastard.

		“Then the next time I see him I’ll shoot him with my blaster, first in the crotch, watch him writhe around on the floor in pain for a few moments, then blast his head off...”
		</p>

		Commodore Hawks interrupted. “Commander Hess, you will control yourself, it won’t be just you who would be affected. The White Coats would take you in, question you, and then torture you when they believe you have more dirt on me and the rest of the battle group’s senior officers and the fate of Aayla Secura will come out, and we’ll all be brought before a military tribunal, found guilty of treason, then shot. Do you want that to happen? Because that’s exactly what will happen if you don’t rein in that temper of yours,” said Jack sternly.

		With great reluctance and barely contained rage she responded with a simple, “Aye sir.”

		“Mirialia please, don’t let your anger control you. What he tried to do to you, and done to several other women before and after is monstrous, but you cannot give in to hate, that path leads to self-destruction,” said Kayla in an attempt to calm the younger officer, at the same time she used the Force to send soothing thoughts to her mind.
		</p>
		<p>
		After she took several deep breaths and calmed down she said, “You’re right, the bastard isn’t worth the energy of a single blaster bolt.”
