		"Does he just hang around the trade routes and lay in wait for merchant ships to fall into his trap?" Commander Hess asked in confusion, since exact trade routes for merchant ships were kept secret so merchantmen couldn't be easily attacked like this.
		</p>
		<p>
		"No, somehow he's getting accurate trade routes for the big industrial bulk freighter lines. Several transport companies have already begun grouping their ships into convoys and sharing the burden of providing escorts, but they're still losing ships and cargo." Jack stood up from the couch and began pacing his quarters a little. Kayla quickly moved to the small kitchen to prepare him a hot drink. Soon enough the strong smell of caf wafted into the atmosphere of the Commodore's quarter's, the smell had an almost uplifting effect on both the Commodore and his XO, who practically lived on the stuff, something that Kayla could not miss on pointing out.

		"If I didn't know any better I'd say you two are completely dependent upon this drink," said Kayla as she set a tray with full pot with a couple of mugs on the table and poured for the both of them.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Aren't you having any?" Mirialia asked in surprise, since most of the Command Staff, including most Jedi, practically ran on the stuff.
		</p>
		<p>
		"I prefer tea to caf, the caffeine content is too high for my species, too stimulating," Kayla replied as she picked up her own mug of steaming hot red tea and took a sip. "Ah, just right," she sighed as she quickly perked up.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Red tea isn't exactly lacking in caffeine either," Mirialia commented in amusement.
		</p>
		<p>
		"True," said Kayla with a secretive smile of her own.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Thank you Kayla," said Jack as he quickly picked up his own mug and began taking quick sips of the very hot drink.
		</p>
		<p>
		"So, any ideas about catching this guy?" Mirialia asked.
		</p>
		<p>
		"Well, right now Imperial Intelligence is working on the theory that Csalas somehow sliced into the transportation companies computer banks and got the exact routes their ships are taking. Our official mission is that we, in concert with a dozen other battle groups are going to be staked out at various points along the trade routes and hopefully be close enough to intercept before they can completely strip the merchantmen of their cargo," said Jack, though he obviously didn't think much of the idea.
		</p>
		<p>
		"It's a fools mission, camping out on the trade routes and hope that somehow we catch them in the act!"
		</p>
		<p>
		"Let me guess, you already have an idea about how we're going to catch them, sir," said Mirialia in anticipation and Jack didn't disappoint.
		</p>
		<p>
		"What these pirates are after is profit, that means they look for the biggest, fattest target they can put their sights on and can take with the least amount of casualties."
		</p>
		<p>
		"Why would he worry about casualties, he normally just sends over droids doesn't he?" Mirialia asked.
