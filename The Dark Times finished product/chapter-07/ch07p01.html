        <h2>Chapter 7: Revelations and Newcomers</h2>
                <p>
				It was a tired but satisfied Commander Hess that walked off the command bridge. After the war game with the Concordia battle group she had managed to get everything back in line and supervised the crew pilot the ship out of the asteroid field, and reviewed the combat logs in the CIC, before she headed for the Commodore's quarters. The crew had performed admirably, but she felt they could do better, though they had managed to cut their launch and scramble time under three minutes. They were not quite up to her preferred standards, but for now it was a good enough start. She so looked forward to breaking in the new arrivals. The Commodore was moderately satisfied, but seemed to agree with her sentiment, which was probably why he asked her to join him in his quarters. She promised to herself that tomorrow when the new arrivals showed up she would be driving them twice as hard until she got the results she and the Commodore wanted to achieve, and knew that everyone was probably going to hate her for it, but the crew didn't have to like her, but both she and the crew needed to respect one another.

				Now she stood before the Commodore’s quarters heavy bulkhead doors, slightly nervous about what he might want to talk to her about. She lightly pushed the buzzer, signalling her presence at the door and she wished to gain entry.

                <p>
				Through the intercom system the Commodore replied, “Enter,” and with a near silent swish the heavy doors opened to reveal the commodore’s quarters. Both Kayla and Jack were sitting on one of the two halves of a circular sofa with a circular table in between. “Please, have a seat commander,” offered Jack, though Commander Hess knew it was an order. She settled herself down and got comfortable. “While I and Kayla here were on the Bespin military base we ran into an old acquaintance of yours, a Commodore Tyko Delmar.” Mirialia’s eyes tightened in anger at that name and her face became white as blood drained from her face.

				“I sense a great deal of fear and anger in you when Jack said his name,” said Kayla.

                <p>
				“You’re damned right I’m angry! That bastard is the reason why I lost my chance to command a ship of my own one day. Plus he’s a chauvinistic pig who thinks that anyone with a pair of breasts is for his own personal enjoyment,” she said with utter disgust.
				</p>
                <p>
				“How long were you under his command?” Jack asked.
				</p>
                <p>
				“I was under his command for six months. For most of that time he was a professional officer and acted like a gentleman, but we were so busy fighting a war I didn’t notice anything amiss before the end of my six month stint aboard his ship. I was a lieutenant commander at the time, assigned as one of several tactical officers. Captain Delmar ruled his crew with an iron fist, he was the captain, and his word was law.” She paused to collect her thoughts.
