		“That arrogant incompetent whelp,” she said beneath her breath, which the Commodore couldn’t help but notice.
        </p>
        <p>
		“There some kind of history between you and this Commodore Delmar?” he asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Yes sir,” she responded reluctantly. “The man is arrogant and condescending,
		and has a rather bloated head about the supposed superiority of regular humans over clones
		and he believes just about everything coming out of the Emperor’s mouthpieces.
		I served under him before joining your command, and the experience was not a good one.”
		</p>
        <p>
		Sensing her unease on this subject the Commodore decided to let the matter drop for now,
		but would make a point to bring it up again in a more private setting, maybe with Kayla present next time.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Helm, assume a standard parking orbit, Commander I leave the ship in your
		capable hands while I’m away,” said the Commodore as he moved towards the command bridge turbolift.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Aye sir, I have the conn,” she replied out of habit.
		</p>
        <p>
		The Commodore quickly descended down to the main launch bay where his personal shuttle awaited,
		a brand new Lambda class shuttle, modified of course by his father’s engineers back at the shipyards.
		As he approached the shuttle he noticed Kayla was standing right in front of the boarding ramp,
		wearing a barely regulation black Imperial duty uniform that looked extremely tight fitting on her,
		the trousers replaced with a short skirt just a few centimetres above the knee,
		and not a single piece of insignia on her uniform.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Kayla, what are you doing?”
		</p>
        <p>
		“I’m going with you!” she replied confidently. “Every captain and commodore that will be
		meeting with the admiral will bring along at least one aide each, or perhaps some entertainment,
		I can be both,” she said as she twirled around seductively, with an electronic note pad cradled in her arms.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Kayla, as much of an asset as you could be to me, it would still be a terrible risk,
		the emperor’s agents might be onboard, and there are rumours that they are all Force sensitive
		and are at least trained enough to recognise another Force sensitive, like yourself, and then the game is up.”
		</p>
        <p>
		“I can’t sense any strong Force sensitive’s anywhere near here, and believe me,
		with this disguise and my surgical alterations to my body nobody will recognise me,” she said sweetly.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Alright, but keep your eyes and ears peeled for anything, if you so much as sense
		one of the emperor’s agents closing in on you, I want you to get out of there as quickly as you can,
		and wear a service blaster instead of your lightsabres,
		those are illegal now you know,” said Jack seriously as he noticed she had strapped her light sabres to her boots.
		</p>
        <p>
		She removed her two lightsabres from her boot holsters with much regret
		as the two of them got onboard the shuttle. The commodore ordered the flight crew to
		launch the shuttle while they made themselves comfortable in the rear passenger compartment,
		which was rather tastefully decorated.
