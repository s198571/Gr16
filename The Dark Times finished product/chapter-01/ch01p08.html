			“Commander, how do you know that Order 66 is still valid now that the Republic is no more?”
		</p>
		<p>
			“I don’t understand.”
		</p>
		<p>
			“Well you were created to protect the Republic from all enemies, both foreign and domestic.
			Now that the Republic has been reorganized into the Galactic Empire,
			it is no longer the Republic that you served and protected these last three years, is it?”
		</p>
		<p>
			Many emotions went through Max’s mind as he thought about what he was now faced with.
			He and his brothers had been used, and now the Republic that he had sworn to protect was no more,
			a huge waste of life just to see a man that he had respected and admired
			turn his beloved Republic into an Empire where freedom was suppressed.
		</p>
		<p>
			“You realise, sir, that if any of my brothers outside of my command heard
			you say such things you and your officers would have been shot on sight
			as traitors?” Commander Max humorously asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			“The thought did cross my mind,” Captain Hawks replied smartly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Captain Hawks saw in Commander Max’s eyes that he was no longer loyal to the Chancellor, now Emperor Palpatine.
		</p>
		<p>
			“I can almost guarantee that every clone onboard will follow your lead, sir,” said Max confidently.
			“However there may be some that will follow Palpatine no matter what, so I have to talk to my brothers,
			and tell my immediate subordinates to find out if any would betray us to the Empire.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Jack merely nodded, and Max rose up from his chair and saluted,
			exiting the captain’s mess with all eyes upon him as he left.
			Jack took another look around his assembled superior officers,
			all having the same question written all over their faces.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Captain, how did this happen, what did we do wrong?” Commander Hess asked.
			“I don’t know, Commander, but what I do know is what’s going to happen to the Jedi.
			They’ll all be hunted down and killed, and I’m not just talking about the knights and the masters,
			not even the younglings will be exempt from this order,” said the captain
			as he cast his eyes down onto the table, everyone in the mess couldn’t bear to look at each other right then.
		</p>
		<p>
			“So what do we do now?” Chief Engineer Ganto asked.
