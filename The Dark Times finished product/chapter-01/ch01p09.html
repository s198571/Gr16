			“For now we keep a low profile and keep our opinions to ourselves,
			there’ll probably be a lot of people like us that see things the way we do,
			but there are many more that has bought the party line about the Jedi orchestrating
			the entire Clone Wars,” said Jack in warning.

			After the impromptu meeting they went back on duty, quietly talking to the various department heads,
			getting a feel for the crew’s reaction to the shift the galaxy has experienced.
			Hours later they received new orders, to head for Coruscant where the Captain would be
			getting a briefing by the new Emperor himself. Jack hadn’t met Palpatine before
			and now this would be his chance to get a measure of the man.
			The Challenger quickly broke orbit and jumped to light speed.
			On the way they picked up a beacon from a nearby star system, a Jedi distress beacon.

			As they closed in on the signal Captain Hawks appeared on the bridge.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Are we close?” he asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			“We’re seconds’ away sir,” reported Commander Hess, and seconds later the Challenger
			decelerated from hyperspeed and straight into the outer reaches of the system,
			quickly finding the source of the distress beacon.

			“Reading as a Jedi Interceptor, its General Secura’s fighter,” she said surprised.
			“There is a lot of carbon scoring in the hull and her hyperdrive rings have been practically destroyed.
			She has definitely been in a fight.”

			“Bring it into the main fighter bay and have a medical team standing by,” the Captain ordered.
		</p>

			An invisible beam of energy latched onto the small Jedi Interceptor and pulled it
			into the main fighter bay, opening the smaller door and switching tractor beam emitters
			for the final stages of landing.

			In the Interceptor Jedi Master Aayla Secura had been waiting for death for several hours now.
			She had managed to get to the neutral star system, but she got jumped by a squadron of ARC 170s that
			had been waiting for her. She managed to destroy all of them, but her fighter was finished,
			the last few shots from her laser cannons that destroyed her final attacker had drained
			the last of her fighter’s energy, her hyperdrive rings had been destroyed and she was completely out of fuel.
		</p>
		<p>
			She put herself into a deep meditative state, knowing that her heart beat would slow
			to a crawl and stretch out her oxygen supply for as long as possible.
			She believed that she was going to die, and had accepted that as a fact of life,
			all living things die; it’s just the timing and the circumstances that are unknown.
			She comforted herself with the thought that she was going to see all those that had died this day,
			but the Force it seems had a very different destiny for her.
