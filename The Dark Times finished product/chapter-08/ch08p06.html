		The Dauntless was ablaze with blue weapons fire as Macdougan unleashed all the firepower he had at his disposal. Four DBY-827 turrets, lifted off a scrapped Venator class SD, spat several megatons of plasmatic energy per shot at the enemy, and pounded relentlessly at its target's shields, even as its torpedo blister unleashed more barrages. Like fast flying comets they crashed into the strained shields of the frigate, and they collapsed as the last torpedo hit, leaving the ship vulnerable to follow-up turbolaser barrages, which ravaged the hull and in seconds the frigate was nothing more than a flaming wreck.

		Meanwhile the Missile Frigates commanders were getting worried, as the number of ships protecting them had dropped down to just one Munificent class frigate, which was now being attacked by the two fresh Nebulon-B frigates in a close range gun duel, and was losing badly as the Renown joined in. In an act of defiance the Missile Frigates stepped up their missile launches. Dozens of missiles per second were filling up the space surrounding them, and most of them were programmed to lock onto the first available target not squawking a friendly IFF. Several V-Wing squadrons got caught up in the massive missile barrage and many went into several dizzying spirals attempting to break their targeting locks, but dozens still fell. An entire squadron was almost wiped out to the last man, and Captain Macdougan had enough, even as missiles began impacting his ship's shields.

		"Redirect all available weapons fire on those missile frigate. I want those ships removed from my sight!" he ordered angrily.

		"We can't sir, our main guns are starting to overheat, and our secondary and CIWS guns are climbing into the red, and our shields are starting to feel the strain," one of the engineering techs reported from the ship's crew-pit.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Launch torpedoes, and power down heavy weapons. Use the freed up energy reserves to bolster the shields. Looks like we're going to have to weather this shit storm," said Captain Macdougan as he braced himself against the tactical holo-tank. "And start cycling the CIWS guns for cool-downs, odd numbered ones first, then switch to even numbered ones, you should have been doing that from the start!"
		</p>
        <p>
		"Sorry sir, the computer..."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Don't make excuses, just do it," Macdougan commanded sternly, and the officer did so.
		</p>
        <p>
		Outside the missile barrage was being felt by everyone. Fighters were racing for cover behind their home ships. The capital ships were ablaze with weapons fire as they actively intercepted the missiles, but many still got through to strike heavily against the shields, and the corvettes were racing to escape the majority of the missile barrage as their own CIWS guns strained to gun down as many missiles as possible. It was bad luck for one of the corvettes that a trio of missiles managed to slip through the CIWS guns fire and hit one after another in the same place. The multi-nacelle engine block. The first two crippled its rear shields, then the last punched through the armour and detonated inside, which destroyed the engineering bay and set off the fuel tanks which proceeded to immolate the entire rear of the corvette and left the rest to be consumed by secondary explosions as smaller liquid tibanna tanks cooked off.

		Several horrifying minutes later the missile barrage ended. The missile bays of the Missile Frigates had been drained dry. As he surveyed the damage done to his ships, Captain Macdougan gives into his anger for just a moment. "Destroy those ships. Ignore their surrender transmissions!"
		</p>
        <p>
		Not one officer on the bridge refused the order. As one the remaining ships returned fire and burned the four Missile Frigates from stem to stern in a violent fury of turbolaser fire and missile and proton torpedo barrages, with the remains of the convoy escort ships joining in. The Missile Frigates put up a fight, but now their weapons were limited to only a few point defence laser cannons and a small number of quad turbolaser turrets. Their resistance was short lived.
