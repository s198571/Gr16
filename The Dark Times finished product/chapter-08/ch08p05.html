		Two of the Munificent class frigates broke off their engagement with the convoy's escort and moved to intercept the Dauntless and its escorts.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Sir, enemy frigates are closing in!" warned one of the bridge officers.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Then let's clear our throats. Prepare to fire the bow chaser, target the lead frigate," Macdougan ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Aye sir," responded the tactical officer responsible for the long range guns.
		</p>
        <p>
		On the bow of the Dauntless a set of heavy blast doors opened up and revealed a large bore cannon which began to glow an eerie blue as it charged up. With a flash it lanced out a powerful beam of pure destruction and pierced the shields of the lead frigate and kept going. It penetrated the metre thick armour plating all the way to one of its main reactors, then breached its containment shielding, unleashed the tightly controlled energy of the reactor and exploded, which destroyed half the frigate, and left it a wreck.
		</p>
        <p>
		A cheer rose up amongst the bridge crew at the sight of the frigate exploded.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Target has been destroyed!" the tactical officer reported.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Good. Target the second one..." Suddenly the ship shook heavily and nearly threw him down to his knees. "Damage report?" he demanded.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Heavy turbolaser barrage from the remaining frigate, they hit the bow chaser as it was powering up. The explosion we felt was the capacitors exploding when they were hit," reported an engineering officer in the crew pit.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Well, looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way. Return fire!"
		</p>
        <p>
		In retaliation the Dauntless fired every turbolaser in near constant salvoes at the offending frigate, and launched six anti-ship proton torpedoes as soon as its shields were severely weakened. The first torpedo collapsed the already strained shields, the next five in the torpedo barrage penetrated the hull at different points along its starboard side and detonated inside, immolating the entire starboard side and pealed it open, leaving all the starboard side internals open to space.
		</p>
        <p>
		The Renown fired its own turbolaser barrage into the offending frigate's side and ended its pirate career as it consumed itself in secondary explosions.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Both frigates have been destroyed, Captain," reported one of the sensor techs.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Concentrate fire on the remaining frigates, get them between us and the convoy escorts, we'll get them in a crossfire," Captain Macdougan ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		Macdougan's group of ships accelerated forward and presented their bows forward for a full on frontal assault on the two remaining Munificent-class frigates who were now on the defensive as they turned broadside on to the two groups of Imperial ships. The remaining ships of the convoy escort, a pair of Dreadnoughts and four Nebulon-Bs, finally got a little breathing room as fire from the enemy was cut in half. The Missile Frigates continuously pumped out heavy concussion missiles as if they had endless amounts in stock at both groups, but more often than not the missiles got intercepted either by fighters or the point defences of the Imperial warships.
