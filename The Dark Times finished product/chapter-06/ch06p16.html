        "War Dog 11 got taken down by an Interceptor, caught him with a couple of concussion missiles up his backside," reported the flight leader in irritation. "Damned Shiny couldn't keep his head on straight, nearly crashed into his wingman when he got hit."

		"I'll have a little chat with him after the mission is complete, but right now we've got trouble! Heads up people, Eta 2 Interceptors closing in from 12 o'clock high, move to intercept!" Captain Snow ordered and Razgriz flight followed in, with engines redlining and laser cannons blazing as the opposing squadrons clashed.

		As they closed in Blaze noticed the Interceptors were coming straight at them. "Heads up, these guys are on a collision course," he said as he put his fighter into a snap roll in an attempt to get out of their way, while still blasting them out of the sky, though not everyone was as successful. One of the Captain Snow's flight got his starboard wing clipped by an Interceptor that also went completely out of control, spinning end over end, while the Z-95 managed to right itself, though it had lost its starboard laser cannon and a good chunk of its wing.

		"Okay, who the hell trained these guys, they're acting like those kamikaze droids we encountered over Muunilist," said Chopper as he swerved to avoid another Interceptor that nearly took out his fighter.

		"Must be some of those new Shinys we heard about, those mass produced Spaarti cloned replicas of the Jango clones, all they've got going for them is numbers," said Blaze as he blasted another out of the war game and continued for the Concordia's engines, with three squadrons worth of Y-wings following close behind.

        <p>
		"Less chatter and more blasting," said one of the War Dogs as he opened up on another Interceptor that had managed to get on Chopper's tail, who broke contact as soon as the laser cannon fire made enough consecutive hits to eliminate it from the war game. Soon enough the form of the rapidly turning Concordia, Gladius and Gorgon loomed ever closer and in the Y-wings their targeting computers chimed with lock-on signals for their ion cannons.

		"All units with ion cannons, fire at will," called out the leader of Gold squadron, his gunner quickly complied and moments later electric blue pulses of energy shot forth from their double barrelled ion cannon turrets, followed by dozens more which impacted on the shields of all three capitals. The rapid infusion of energy ironically strengthened the shields momentarily, but the ion particles interacted violently with the shields, and promptly shorted them out. Arcs of electricity danced across the hulls of all three capital ships and cut their acceleration to zero as their engines were momentarily disabled, their large plasma-ion drives sputtered out and were silent, and the Y-wings pulled away, pulling extremely tight turns as they pulled away from the incoming avenging fighters.

		"Looks like we kicked up a hornet's nest, all fighters pull back to the barn for rearming, then we'll come back and finish them off," commanded the Challenger's CAG (Commander Air Group) who was coordinating the fighters from the Challenger's air-traffic-control tower.
		</p>
        <p>
		The first to fall back were the remaining Y-wing and ARC-170 fighter bombers, with dozens of fighter squadrons covering their backs, though now it was time for the Concordia battle group's remaining five corvettes to get some payback as they closed in to cut off the depleted squadrons escape. With blistering volleys of green laser cannon fire they rained hell upon the Challenger's fighter squadrons, several boosted their engines to maximum to run the gauntlet, counting on their targeting computers being too slow to accurately track and lock on to all of them, though several still got shot down. The return fire from the fighters were merely fighter mounted laser cannons, most of them having depleted their stocks of missiles and torpedoes on attack runs on capital ships and one of the corvettes, but when hundreds of fighters combined open fire a corvette's shields even their relatively weak laser cannons have an effect.
