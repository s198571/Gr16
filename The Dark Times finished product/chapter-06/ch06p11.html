		"Comm. silence terminated, all fighters, weapons free, clear a road for the bombers," Ordered Captain Snow.

		"Yeehaa, let's show these guys how we do it," whooped Chopper as he accelerated ahead of formation.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Chopper get back in formation with Archer, remember rule number one, never leave your wingman behind, or so help me when we get back to the ship I'll have you washing all of our fighters with a toothbrush. A small one," Blaze threatened, and Chopper pulled back on the throttle enough for the rest of the flight to catch up with him.

		"Sorry sir, got a little excited that's all."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Yes, but also remember rule number two," retorted Blaze as he accelerated slightly and rolled, lined up his laser cannons on a veritable cloud of targets and cut loose with a blistering volley of blue laser cannon fire from wingtip mounted six barrelled Z-60 rotary laser cannons, and eliminated six V-Wings in seconds.

		"Always mind your surroundings!" said Edge as she opened fire on a V-Wing that had managed to get on Blaze's tail. It ducked and swerved out of her cannon fire, and was forced to abandon its pursuit of Blaze's fighter. Suddenly a concussion missile left one of Edge's missile launchers, magnetically accelerated from the launch tube and its own plasma rocket motor kicked in, and scared the hell out of the clone pilot who executed a dizzying corkscrew manoeuvre and popped decoy pods to spoof the missile. Too little, too late, the missile homed in mid corkscrew and impacted just a second after it launched its counter-measures.

		"Well said you two, and nice work, now let's clear a path for our boys in the bombers!" ordered Captain Snow as the rest of the squadron moved ahead to the front. Seconds later the two sides fighter forces clashed, low powered laser shots crisscrossed space, and fighters split up into pairs and went after each other in a vicious dance, all jockeying for the optimum firing position.

		Blaze and Edge formed up into a pair and began to clear a path, one attacking, the other defending as the situation dictated. War Dog squadron, along with several other fighter squadrons from the Challenger formed a wedge of fighters and proceeded to drive a hole through the Concordia battle-group's fighter screen. A squadron of twelve Z-95s accelerated ahead and ran headlong into one of the defending corvettes, which proceeded to try to blast them out of the sky. Try being the appropriate word, as they pushed their fighters engines hard and only made one high speed pass, each launching a pair of dummy concussion missiles along with sustained bursts from their wingtip mounted laser cannons, all while under the hailstorm of weapons fire, but that was just a feint. Behind the fighters lurked a squadron of eight ARC-170s who waited for the fighters that were ahead of them had passed the enemy corvette before they launched anti-ship proton torpedoes, hitting the already weakened, in real-time simulation, shields and collapsed them, leaving the ship vulnerable for a follow-up strafing run. The ARC-170s came in fast and hit hard with heavy laser cannons blazing, landing low-powered laser bolts along the entire length of the ship, taking out, virtually, all of its guns and missile launchers. As the final fighter flew past, it dropped a proton bomb from its ventral bomb bay, and hit the engineering section dead-on, eliminating the corvette from the war-game.
