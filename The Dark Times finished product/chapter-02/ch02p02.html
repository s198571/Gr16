                “Let me know when she is fit to be taken out of the tank, I want to speak with her personally,”
				said Jack, getting the doctor’s reluctant nod in reply and then headed back to the bridge.

				A day later the Challenger came out of Hyperspace just outside Coruscant’s orbit and was put into
				a holding parking orbit. Unlike most Venator class cruisers, the Challenger was simply too big to land
				on a planet’s surface. Soon after they were put into parking orbit the Captain went
				to his debriefing with the Emperor. Coming along with him was Commander Max and a squad of his best troopers,
				he had also been summoned before the Emperor and Jack was not looking forward to this.
				For some reason he was feeling a sense of dread coming upon him as they approached the capital of the new Empire.

				The LAAT/i gunship flew through the busy sky lanes of Coruscant, heading straight for what was
				once the Palace of the Republic, now renamed the Imperial Palace.
				It was a tall structure, nearly three kilometres tall and was a single skyscraper with a wide base,
				however there was a lot of new construction around the palace, slowly taking shape.
				The gunship landed in one of the palace’s many cavernous hangar bays, where a large number of shuttles
				and gunships had also just recently landed, Captain Hawks and Commander Max were among the last
				of those to arrive, and everyone else had already gone in. A mouse droid with a small holo-projector
				was waiting for them. A small hologram of a protocol droid sprang to life.

				“Please follow the mouse droid to the main conference room, and do not deviate from the planned route,
				the consequences would be most unfortunate.”
				</p>
                <p>
				Heeding the droid’s words they didn’t waste any time and followed the mouse droid to a large auditorium.
				The highest ranking admirals and generals were at the front, further back were the lower ranked
				admirals and at the back were the captains of a select few ships and combat squadrons.
				From what Jack could see this was a gathering of some of the most respected and highest ranked
				individuals in the Grand Army of the Republic, now the Imperial Navy and Army.

                <p>
				From a side door the Emperor entered wearing a simple black cloak, surrounded by a personal bodyguard
				of six Red Guards, the recently commissioned protectors of the emperor which gave everyone in the room chills.
				The Emperor took centre stage and addressed the assembled officers.
