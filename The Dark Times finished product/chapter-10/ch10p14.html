		"I was lucky though, all things considered. One of his fellow agents caught him before he completed his business and threw him off of me. The real tragedy was that just a few weeks later that same officer that saved me was killed on an intelligence gathering op on Christophsis, most likely on Major Riskovat's orders. Now that he has the power of the Imperial Security Bureau at his back..."

		"I'm here now, and I promise you that this monster will never again touch you," Jack swore softly into her ear. They stood there in the observation dome for several long minutes, which felt like hours to the both of them, but for career military officers their duties are never more than a comlink away. Neither are nosy parents who just happen to be on the same space station.

        <p>
		"Jack where are you? I need to talk about the hundreds of tons of loot you just shipped to my shipyards," his father loudly asked over the intercom, breaking the mood.
		</p>
        <p>
		Very quickly Commander Hess dried her tears and straightened out her uniform and adopted her traditional stern business face. "Another reason why I hate your father," she grumbled under her breath.
		</p>
        <p>
		"I know you dragged your xo into the observation dome, so I expect you two to clean up after yourselves."
		</p>
        <p>
		This caused both of them to redden greatly, and Jack quickly activated his comlink. "You had better not be broadcasting this over the entire station, or else?"
		</p>
        <p>
		The old man merely chortled. "Don't worry my boy, it's all on a private channel. Nobody but you, Mirialia, and everyone in this room with me can hear you."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Sir, I know he's your father, but can I please maim him, just a little," Commander Hess asked pleadingly.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Don't tempt me," he responded, knowing that Hal could hear everything they said over his comlink. "I'll meet you up at your office in a few minutes." He then switched off his comlink then took Commander Hess's upper arms in his hands and gave them a short reassuring squeeze. "You feeling better now?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"Much better, and a lot safer," she said, and then completely out of the blue rushed forward and embraced him. "Thank you for listening and not judging me."
		</p>
        <p>
		"You're welcome commander, just remember what I said, my door is always open for you." He smiled reassuringly at her then walked out of the observation dome. As she watched him leave she felt a slight ache in her heart, but hope still welled up inside her of their upcoming trip.

        <p>
		I just have to try to share him with Aayla and the Challenger I guess," she shrugged to herself and found that the idea didn't sound so bad.
		</p>

		<h3>INS Challenger</h3>
		<h3>Sickbay</h3>

		<p>
		The atmosphere of the sickbay aboard the Challenger was relatively relaxed. No one was rushing around and no one was calling out in pain, and Aayla was basking in the momentary peace while Ahsoka and Barris snoozed more peacefully in their beds than they had earlier, and since she had first seen them she had not left their side except to go to the bathroom and the nurses had graciously brought up her meals from the mess hall.
