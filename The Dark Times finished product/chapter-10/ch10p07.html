		On the other end of the docking tube a trio of familiar faces as well as a new face was waiting for them. Two of them were civilians, the other two were military officers.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Dad, mister Blissex," Jack greeted warmly then stiffened and saluted his superior officer. "Admiral Rod, this is a surprise."
		</p>
        <p>
		Admiral Rod returned the salute. "I thought I should hear your report in person rather than in a holographic transmission, plus I wanted to introduce a new addition to your battle group. I present to you Captain Willem Bush, commanding officer of the Tector-class battleship INS Retribution."
		</p>
        <p>
		The Commodore's eyebrows rose up in surprise as the new captain saluted him. "It is an honour to meet you sir, I have been looking forward to serving under your command," he said professionally and Jack took a moment to look over his new captain. He was roughly in his early forties and stood a good couple of inches shorter than him. He had brown eyes that spoke of long experience and a short crop of ginger hair that was in the early stages of receding, had a gaunt face and a vaguely beak-like nose.

        <p>
		"It's a pleasure to meet you," said Jack as he searched his memory of known ship captains and pulled out a memory from three years before. "Weren't you in command of the Victory-class destroyer RNS Victor at the Third Battle of Fondor in the Clone Wars?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"That was a long time ago. I have now moved on to a bigger ship," the older captain said neutrally.
		</p>
        <p>
		"It certainly is bigger than the old Victory-I class," said Hal with a slight chuckle. "And definitely far more powerful. In a one on one engagement I don't know if the Challenger would even be able to engage it successfully without taking crippling damage without support. Especially with the improvements we've made to the Retribution."
		</p>
        <p>
		"What improvements?" Jack asked, and he could detect a glimmer of a smile form on Captain Bush's lips which then disappeared just as quickly as it came.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Follow me gentlemen," said Mister Blissex. He led them over to a nearby repulsorlift sled and inputted their destination, while the rest of the group sat down on the sled. Minutes later they arrived at another dry-dock and was then later led to an observation deck with a wide-angle view overlooking the bow of a 1.6 kilometre long dagger shaped battleship. Several zero g construction droids and yard workers were still installing a number of small weapons mounts and conducting final checks on one of the main gun turrets.

        <p>
		"Gentlemen and Lady, I present to you the INS Retribution, the latest addition to the Challenger Battle Group," Hal presented dramatically.
		</p>
        <p>
		Jack was impressed, but not in awe of the Retribution since while there are few Tector-class battleships far more were under construction along with the Imperial-class, but he quickly noticed a number of differences from a standard Tector. The most obvious was three four barrel heavy turbolaser turrets along the top centreline just ahead of the bridge tower, along with a number of smaller weapons that he didn't remember being a part of the standard design.
