		"I see you've made a few changes," Jack stated as he took a careful look at other views of the ship that were being displayed on a number of smaller monitors mounted to the ceiling.

        <p>
		"I see you've noticed. We've added a number of weapons systems, including some new point defence systems. An improved version of the CIWS turrets, which you'll be getting in your refit, and a number of new guns and eliminated as many blind spots as we could."

        <p>
		Jack smirked a little at Captain Bush. "If I wasn't so attached to the Challenger I might have made the Retribution my flagship," he said jokingly.

        <p>
		"I'm sorry sir, but you can't have her, besides I don't think you would like a couple of crewmembers that I have onboard," the older captain retorted mildly.

		"Maybe we should have this conversation somewhere a little more privately," Admiral Rod suggested.
		</p>
        <p>
		Once again they travelled by repulsor lift sled, but this time it was into the administrative area of the shipyards. Their destination the same conference room that Hal Hawks and Wallex Blissex had presented the plans for the Challenger's first refit and post-Clone Wars overhaul. They each took a seat around the conference table and Captain Bush explained himself.

		"I have a number of ISB officers stationed aboard my ship, and short of spacing them I can't get them off my ship," he explained in that same neutral tone, but his subtle body language revealed the career military officer's frustration. Commodore Hawks and Commander Hess's faces darkened considerably at such bad news. "There are currently two public officers that I know are coordinating a number of moles spread amongst my crew. Most of them I've known from my days in the Clone Wars, but with so many new recruits coming onboard to fill in the gaps it's nearly impossible to know who to trust these days."

        <p>
		"Unfortunately I've got some more bad news for you Commodore," began Admiral Rod apologetically. "ISB is sending agents to act as political officers and advisors to almost every ship in the fleet, which includes all of your big capital ships. I'm afraid they're now going to become a staple of the Imperial Navy."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Great, which just makes staying off the Emperor's watch list all the more difficult, and make our job that little bit harder. Do we at least know who they are sending?"
		</p>
        <p>
		The Admiral nodded and brought up a holo-bust of the agent. "His name is Colonel Neraj Riskovat. Former Republic Army intelligence who specialised in aggressive interrogations, most likely involving some kind of torture, and his methods towards the end of the Clone Wars just became worse and worse until he finally crossed the line even most in intelligence would never cross and he got booted out. He was recruited by ISB to conduct aggressive loyalty examinations only months after Order 66 was issued."
		</p>
        <p>
		Commander Hess's fists tightened slightly in recognition, which Jack quickly recognised as a very strong indication of stress. With only a few brief looks they mutually agreed to talk about this later.
		</p>
        <p>
		"All in all he's not that bad of an officer. He just enjoys his work, which just so happens to be making people tell him things that you wouldn't even reveal to your own mistress, and when he finds traitors he doesn't just go after the traitor, he goes after the ones closest to the traitor just to twist the knife even deeper," concluded the Admiral.
