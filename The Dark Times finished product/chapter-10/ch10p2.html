		Immediately the two former slaves inspected their still healing necks and wrists and saw and felt that their shackles were truly gone, replaced by bacta-wraps. "Thank you doctor for removing our bindings," said Ahsoka gratefully.

		"All part of the service. Now, let me take a look at those burns," said the doctor as he slowly approached, but Barris curled up into a tight ball and shrunk away from him with still terrified eyes. "Relax young lady. I'm a doctor, and I'm here to help." She looked to Ahsoka who smiled reassuringly at her and she uncurled from her ball and let the doctor take a closer look at her wounds. He smiled at the progress she showed. "Well young lady, looks like you're healing right on schedule. I give it maybe a couple of weeks before a complete recovery and by that time the chemicals should be completely out of your system. Now Ahsoka, let's take a look at you, get back to your bed please. Nurse, would you check her IV?" he requested as Ahsoka made her way back to her bed with a slightly sheepish look on her face as she became painfully aware of the IV she nearly pulled earlier, which the nurse gently reinserted fully into her vein again.

		The doctor proceeded to inspect her own burns and injection sites and hummed with satisfaction. "You too are healing well, even faster than your friend. It always amazes me how you trained Force sensitive's heal so rapidly."
		</p>
        <p>
		"What can I say, we heal quickly." The doctor smiled at his togruta patient's little quip and focused more on her electronic chart. His brow furrowed slightly.

		"Well, according to this your bodies are rapidly breaking down those chemicals, but I suggest you both stay for medical supervision. The two spices that Csalas used have been known to cause severe withdrawal and that could prove to be, at best, most uncomfortable to nearly unbearable, almost certainly lethal." His two patients faces showed their worry, with Ahsoka showing a very distinct dislike, while Barris began shivering in fear. "It should only take a few days for it to subside, and we can treat the withdrawal symptoms, but the two of you will be bedridden for at least a week."

		Aayla put her hands on both of their shoulders. "I'll be with you the entire time," she said reassuringly. There was an uncomfortable silence as the two medical professionals took care of the two of them. "Maybe you could tell me what happened to you two since Order 66?" Both Jedi looked very reluctant to talk about what happened to them, but Aayla persisted. "I know that discussing such things are painful, but trust me, you'll feel better if you do."

        <p>
		Both Ahsoka and Barris looked to each other and in silent agreement Ahsoka began talking.

		<h3>INS Challenger</h3>
		<h3>Command Bridge, CIC</h3>

		The CIC was buzzing with activity, and Commander Hess was right in the middle of it. She displayed neither satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the progress of work the crew of the CIC was doing, but her steely gaze still unnerved the people working under her, and she loved that feeling of knowing she was the most feared and respected officer under Commodore Jack Hawks' command, and she only had to answer to him, which gave her a really warm and fuzzy feeling inside her.

		She was currently supervising the salvage operations that were currently ongoing. Six former Separatist warships were now effectively in their hands and completely under their control along with their onboard crew of droids which were in the process of being reprogrammed to serve the battle group, their organic captains having either been persuaded to help with the recovery effort or had been killed in the battle.
