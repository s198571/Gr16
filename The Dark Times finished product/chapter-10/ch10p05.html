		She paled at the thought of being at the doc's tender mercies for anything less than a serious injury.

		"Ok, ok, I'll go to my quarters and rest, you're a very evil man," she said quietly as she walked closely by her Commodore.

        <p>
		Jack could only grin back at her. "Sometimes it's good to be the Commodore! Rikard I suggest you get back to your engine room, I'm sure somebody has fowled something up in your absence," he said pointedly.

        <p>
		"Sir, aren't you going to order me to get some rest?" he asked innocently.
		</p>
        <p>
		"No, because unlike my lovely xo you're not a workaholic and know how to relax. Besides you love your job."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Yes sir," said the chief engineer as he stepped off the CIC and into the closest turbolift, while Jack took a pad from the plot table and began reading it as work in the CIC picked up.

		<h3>Corellian System</h3>
		<h3>The next day</h3>

		<p>
		The space in the Corellian system was as hectic as ever with various ships of all shapes and sizes both civilian and military coming and going at all hours of the day. Just outside the systems inner asteroid field seventeen warships, which included the five captured warships, came out of hyperspace, all damaged to some degree and then headed into the asteroid field where the Hawks Shipyards was safely nestled. From the asteroid field came a squadron of Eta-2 Interceptors which the battle group followed through the safe passage.

        <p>
		The asteroid field contained not only huge rocks and the shipyards, it also had a number of hidden mine fields, mostly disguised as smaller clouds of asteroids or even planted on small asteroids. Most were ion mines armed with proximity fuses, designed to disable vessels from small starfighters to big multi-kilometre long warships, while others were simple plasma mines that shot out directed jets of white hot plasma in the general direction of the ship that had set it off. There were also a number of defence satellites equipped with similar stealth systems as the stealth corvettes Ghost and Shadow and normally took on the appearance of asteroids, armed with heavy plasma cannons, CIWS laser cannons and box launchers for concussion missiles, and had a single shield generator.

        <p>
		This is what the commodore remembered from his latest encrypted communiqué from his father and had filtered the information down the chain of command so everyone knew not to stray from the Interceptors path, otherwise the foolish captain would see his ship destroyed before he or she has a chance to defend themselves. He watched from his command chair as he observed his crew and enjoyed the view of returning home again. Soon enough he saw the Hawks Shipyards fill up the view ports and watched as their guides peeled off, having guided them safely to their final destination.
		</p>
        <p>
		A number of small tractor beam tugs came out from the Shipyards outer docking slips and guided in the battle group's ships and its latest acquisitions into their own slips, except for the pair of Lucrehulks who are too big for the biggest docking slips. In minutes the ships of the Challenger battle group were safely docked and the slipways closed up around the ships.
