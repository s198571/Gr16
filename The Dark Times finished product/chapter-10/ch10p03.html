		One Lucrehulk-class droid control ship and one Lucrehulk-class battleship were captured relatively intact thanks to ARC-trooper led boarding parties that captured the ships bridges. Three Recusant-class destroyers were also captured with minimal resistance since their engineering sections had been cleanly cut away from them, and Csalas's flagship had also been captured, though sadly they failed to capture the bastard himself, which nearly broke here iron clad grip upon her self-control.

		To her surprise the Commodore came up to the CIC. "Sir, what brings you here, I thought you were taking a break?"
		</p>
        <p>
		"A two hour catnap in my quarters is more than enough for me. What's the status of the salvage operation?" he asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Well the salvage and repair droids are making good progress on the three Recusant-class destroyers. They've reattached the engineering sections and got main power back online. Latest reports had them at being ready for a hyperspace jump back to Corellia within the hour. However Merchants Terror is almost a complete write-off. Its hyperdrive was destroyed in the battle and the hull is too badly damaged to survive a trip through hyperspace. It's a wonder its hull is still able to maintain air-tight integrity."

        <p>
		The Commodore sighed slightly in resignation. "Too bad, I wanted it for a trophy. Alright, strip it down to its barebones, take anything and everything of value, and tell the salvage teams to keep a weather eye out for the ship's ECM systems. I just finished reading the report from the CIWS tactical officer. The pirates ability to throw up a literal electronic wall for our CIWS targeting systems is a worrying development."
		</p>
        <p>
		The Commander nodded in agreement. "I'll make sure that they keep a weather eye open," she said as she began addressing the entire CIC. "And if they don't find it I'll use them for training rounds for the ship's mass accelerator cannons!"
		</p>
        <p>
		Just as Commander Hess said her unofficial order Commander Ganto came to the CIC carrying a pad.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Ah Rikard, how fares your fair lady?" the Commodore asked him which the older Chief Engineer responded to with a half smile. "Well she weathered the battle pretty well. Portside shield generators were slightly overtaxed and had to switch over to secondary generators, which left us open for a couple of seconds during our brief broadside exchange with the Tempo Diablo and we lost a few good square metres of outer armour plating, but none of it managed to get through to the battle-plating, so no damage there. We lost a couple of secondary guns and three CIWS mounts, all of which can be replaced at our next port of call."
		</p>
        <p>
		"Well you're in luck Old Man," said Commander Hess teasingly. "It's the end of our six month tour so we'll be heading back to Corellia for our next refit, and remember, six months on, two months off in peace time," she said grinning her very shark-like grin which unnerved everyone in the CIC.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Commander, why are you grinning like a shark?" the Commodore asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		"Oh, just thinking what I'm going to do with my share of the prize money," she said gleefully, which also spawned an equally greedy grin on the older chief engineer's face, but a confused look came over the Commodore's face.
