	<h2>Challenger Class Star Destroyer/Carrier</h2>

	<p>
	A 1.6 kilometre version of the popular Venator class attack cruiser the Challenger was the first of what was supposed to be a series of thirty ships, but due to the realities of war only the Challenger was completed in mid 20 BBY. The rest of the hulls were only partially completed and only nine more came online by the end, but by direct order of the Emperor the completed Challenger class ships were quietly shelved and only the Challenger was put in service. Construction work was halted on the rest.
	</p>
	<h3>Characteristics:</h3>

	<p>
	Being a 1.6 kilometre long version of the classic Venator class it has more internal space, meaning it can carry more fighters and has far more room for fuel and other resources, making it far more capable of independent operations than the smaller Venator. The internal structure is separated more into sealable sections than most star destroyers, except for the Tector-class, and each is easily sealed by highly dense and thick durasteel blast doors to seal off damaged sections.
	</p>
	<p>
	The hull itself is built up of several layers. The first being a thin layer of durasteel 300 millimetres thick laid over a dense durasteel framework, then an 800 millimetre thick layer of beskar strengthened duranium battle plate and finally an outer layer of ablative armour that is roughly a metre thick. When energy weapons fire hits the ablative armour its designed to burn off and eat away the energy, leaving only the physical impact.

	During the Clone Wars the ship's paint scheme was the standard red and white of the Republic, and had a distinctive marking on the main hull. A Corellian Hawk with its wings spread with a circle of five orbs at its talons, representing the five inhabited planets of the Corellian system. Now being a part of the Imperial Navy its now become a dark gun metal grey with dark blue trim on the edges, the main doors for the dorsal launch bay and at the top of the dual bridges, but the Corellian Hawk emblem is still there, only slightly faded.

	<p>
	Its sixteen DBY-1000 tri-barrelled turbolaser cannons are twice as powerful as the old DBY-827 turbolaser turrets installed in the previous Venator class and can provide a greater volume of fire at full power than the older turrets in similar firing mode. The guns are also far more accurate at long range, and in low power settings its rate of fire is three times greater. This is useful when engaging in close range gun duels where rate of fire and power levels are critical when knocking down enemy shields.
	</p>
	<p>
	The SPHA beam turbolaser cannons are extreme long range line of sight weapons, which fires a condensed beam of pure blue plasma that has been known to cut through every known shield in seconds. Only in a few instances has this weapon come up against starship shields which could hold out and planetary ray shields are among the few which can absorb its beams without fail.
	</p>
	<p>
	The ship's shield grid is an odd one for a KDY design. Instead of having just the primary shield generators on top of the Command towers there are several smaller but just as powerful shield generators placed in the main hull as well as dedicated bridge shield generators. Having less area to cover the shields are a lot more dense and require much more firepower to blast through than on a standard Venator-class or even an Imperial-class star destroyer. It also means that the shields have more redundancy, just knocking one generator out won't compromise the entire shield grid.
	</p>
	<p>
	The main hangar bay is multiple decks high and has three main levels. The top level is the launch and recovery bay for the fighters and has at all times a number of squadrons on ready standby for launch in side-bays. The second level is where fighters are stored and maintained. The third level is for shuttles and land vehicles and has direct access to the ventral launch bay. There are six large elevators which are big enough to lift a single fully loaded Sentinel-class landing shuttle and two are each placed at opposite ends of the hangar and two in the middle.
