	<h1>Acclamator III heavy frigate;</h1>
	<h2>INS Dauntless and INS Endurance</h2>

	<p>
	An evolution of the Acclamator II class assault frigate, these two ships have been rebuilt from the ground up as brand new warships and test-beds for new technologies, including spinal mounted SPHA turbolaser cannons, and multi-purpose munitions launchers capable of launching everything in the Imperial arsenal, from concussion missiles to proton torpedoes. The armour also incorporates Beskar in its makeup, however due to shortages of this material only these two and the Challenger herself will get this new armour any time soon.
	</p>

	It also carries three squadrons of V-Wing interceptors, a single squadron of ARC-170 strike fighters, 12 Nu class assault shuttles and 2 Sentinel class landing ships. Has a crew of 700 officers and men and an onboard marine unit of 300 troopers.
