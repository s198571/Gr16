	<h2>Preface</h2>
	<p>
	I started writing this piece of fiction over three years ago under the pen name Tscorpio1701 after
	reading a number of fan fiction stories on fanfiction.net and other interesting fan fiction forums.
	It originally started as a way of staving off boredom at my first job and I found to my surprise that
	I actually enjoyed it. The story was also born out of a desire to explore a universe that I have
	enjoyed since I was a child and I wanted to write a story that was about choices.
	</p>
	<p>
	Choices and deeds that people make is what defines a person, and I wanted to write about a group of
	people who was between a rock and a hard place and the possible slippery slope they could possibly
	slide down. I also wanted to make it a way of airing out my opinion about women's rights and basic
	human rights, or in this case sentient rights.
	</p>
	<p>
	I originally started off with the title Venator's Revival in reference to the type of ship my
	characters were flying around in. I wanted to make a sort of post-war drama with all sorts battles
	with the scum of the criminal underworld. I also wanted a villain that was both my hero character's equal,
	and opposite, but failed in the first go around with a previously existing villain, so I started almost from scratch.
	I tried again with Renegade Venator, but I eventually just began again completely from scratch, this time with a
	little more planning and forethought and a new title, which I remembered from a line in
	A New Hope by Obi-Wan Kenobi to Luke Skywalker, The Dark Times.
	</p>
	<p>
	I wish to acknowledge the help with story ideas and constructive criticism provided by two fellow
	contributors on the Spacebattles creative writing forum, Whisky08 and DantheVanMan along with my
	mum and dad for putting up with my little obsession.
