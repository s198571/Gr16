	<h2>Characters.</h2>

	<h3>Commander Rikard Ganto.</h3>
	<p>
	Chief Engineer who was also the one who led the construction team that built the Challenger. Treats the Challenger as if it was a living thing. Jokingly says to anyone that he could feel exactly what speed they were travelling by the feel of the deck plates. An engineer with excellent credentials, he was asked by Tarkin to come work for him when he was a lieutenant, but said no, saying he would not work for someone like him. Tarkin retaliated by putting a black mark on his record, making it insanely difficult to get promoted.
	</p>
	<p>
	Captain Jack Hawks brought him out of the black and told him any enemy of Tarkin was a friend of his, and put him in charge of, what was then called, Project Challenger.
	</p>
	<p>
	A rotund man, but more muscle than fat. A genius in the engine room. Has a reputation for making the impossible possible. Able to get repairs done faster than anyone else, (mainly by overestimating the repair estimates, by multiplying them by a factor of four.)
	</p>

	<h3>Commander Mirialia Hess.</h3>

	<p>
	A strong woman, who can best be described as a spitfire, and has a take no prisoners attitude towards her enemies. She has shoulder length straight brown hair which she keeps in a tight regulation ponytail, is roughly five foot ten and a trim athletic figure with almost no excess fat on her body.
	</p>
	<p>
	Has an extremely short temper, an extreme dislike of men, except for Commodore Hawks who brought her career out from the black. Barely tolerates the men under her command. Previous commander tried to rape her. Hates him with a passion, and wants him dead, both for his attempt, and for molesting  other women under his command that she couldn't stop. Hates Colonel Riskovat for raping her early in her career.

	<h3>ISB Colonel Narej Riskovat. (DS9 Dukat)</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
	Assigned ISB agent afloat aboard Challenger. Butts heads with the Commodore and Commander Hess on a regular basis. Assigned after Arulo Csalas' pirates have been taken care of. Comes aboard after Aayla leaves. Has a nasty tendency to stick his nose into everything, and ends up alienating everyone aboard. Only official ISB agent in the battle group, mostly there as an advisor and to take command if it is proven that the Commodore has proven disloyal to the New Order. Also coordinates the various ISB agents scattered amongst the crew, constantly keeping their ears open. All brainwashed into believing the Emperor is and always will be their leader, practically worship him as a deity.
	</p>

	<h3>Imperial Intelligence Commander Jared Macintyre. (DS9 Garak)</h3>

	<p>
	Former Republic Navy Intelligence. Protégé of Admiral Yularen. Intelligence agent aboard Challenger, meant to provide Intelligence rapports to the Commodore and conduct intelligence briefings. Former field agent. Uses his own skills to foil every power grab made by ISB agent. Has secret agents of his own aboard every ship in the battle group and know the identity of almost every secret ISB agent.
	</p>
	<h3>Admiral Wullf Yularen, Head of Outer Rim Operations.</h3>

	<p>
	A young Admiral and a part of the old guard from before the Rise of the New Order, he is roughly six foot tall, has dark brown hair that's begun to prematurely grey and has grown a well trimmed moustache.
	</p>
	<p>
	An old friend of Admiral Carth Rod, he works with the Anti-Piracy Fleet to uncover the hiding places of Separatist holdouts. He has a central intelligence ship that's always on the move, the Imperial Class SD INS Searcher. On this ship, modified with the most advanced communications suite on any ship in service he can keep in touch with the thousands of operatives under his command without fear of intelligence leaks. He is at first loyal to the New Order, but as reports come in a far darker image of the Empire reveals itself to him. He is firmly against the slavery of sentient beings. Is disgusted by the actions of Moff Tarkin.
	</p>


	<h3>Captain Lela Rothgild.</h3>
	<p>
	Captain of the INS Intrepid. A short red headed woman with a petite form, but a very commanding presence, wears her hair in an extremely tight ponytail that reaches just below her shoulders. Dark brown eyes, tanned skin, rumour has it she keeps a tanning bed on her ship to maintain it.
	</p>
	<p>
	She has a no nonsense attitude, but she has been known to let her hair down with officers of equal rank and higher, but only those she respects. Like most officers she has a strong need for caf, and takes it black with no additives, and prefers an extremely strong blend from Corelag.
	</p>
	<p>
	<h3>Captain Willem Bush.</h3>

	A man in his early forties with ginger hair and brown eyes, is five foot ten, narrow face, almost gaunt and a big beak-like nose. A strict disciplinarian he exercises his crew hard, but knows when to give some slack, but only a little, and only to correct a mistake. He doesn't believe the party line that it was the Jedi that was responsible for the Clone Wars, but he knows that to keep his head on he needs to keep his mouth shut.
	</p>
	<p>
	He is an equal rights commanding officer. He doesn't care if a crewman is a man, woman or alien, as long as they bring their skill and competence to the job. He buts heads with the ISB Agent afloat over who is loyal and who is disloyal to the empire.
	</p>

	<h3>Lieutenant Nia Halloran</h3>

	<p>
	The chief aide to Admiral Carth Rod, she is a Chandrilan native who originally joined the Republic Navy with the dream of eventually leading a ship of her own into combat, however her skill set made her more adept at administration rather than combat. She is punctual and studious, and very precise, and expects everyone around her to follow her example, but gets annoyed when nobody manages to measure up to her standards, in particular Admiral Rod whom she personally admires, but sometimes she feels the urge to rap him over the head with her knuckles.
	</p>
	<p>
	She is a short woman, petite and blonde with slanted green eyes.
