“By bringing the entire galaxy under one law, one language, and the enlightened guidance of one individual, 
the corruption that plagued the Republic in its later years will never take root. 
Regional governors will eliminate the bureaucracy that allowed the Separatist movement to grow unchecked.
A strong and growing military will ensure the rule of law… Under the Empire's New Order, 
our most cherished beliefs will be safeguarded. We will defend our ideals by force of arms. 
We will give no ground to our enemies and will stand together against attacks from within or without. 
Let the enemies of the Empire take heed: Those who challenge Imperial resolve will be destroyed.”

The Senate went wild, cheering their new Emperor, not knowing that they were signalling the end of democracy.

“Watch Commander, and see the end of liberty,” Jack said to his xo in sadness. 
He ordered the monitor turned off and regarded his senior officers.

“Now you see what has happened, we all see what has been happening in the last day. 
The clones have turned on the Jedi because of one order, Order 66. 
An order that could only be issued by the Chancellor himself and that calls 
for the head of every Jedi in the order, and they followed it without question, 
without solid proof of their treachery, just on the word of a single man and his cohorts. 
The Chancellor has now made himself Emperor of the entire galaxy and destroyed 
the very group that protected it. Max, as the senior clone officer in the room 
I want to hear your opinion on all of this.”

Jack could see the many gears turning in the clone’s head, having to really think over his beliefs before he answered.

“Sir, orders are to be obeyed as long as they are legal and right. 
To question those orders, especially an Executive Order is tantamount to treason,” said Max in response.

“Commander, how do you know that Order 66 is still valid now that the Republic is no more?”

“I don’t understand.”
