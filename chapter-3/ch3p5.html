				Jack took in the sight of his home, happy to finally come back after two long hard years
				of heavy combat, death and destruction. Commander Hess used her ever present head-set to
				activate the ships communication system.
				</p>
                <p>
				“This is the Challenger Battle Group requesting permission to dock.”
				</p>
                <p>
				On one of the monitors an older man came on and said,” You have permission to dock Challenger.
				Slips have been made available for you, slave your navigational systems to us
				and we’ll guide you and your ships in. Welcome home.” It was Jack’s father.
				</p>
                <p>
				“It’s good to be home,” Jack said quietly.
				</p>
                <p>
				“You lived here?” Master Secura asked, startling both Jack and his xo.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Yes, I was born on that station. My father owns and runs these shipyards,”
				Jack answered slightly flustered. “Shouldn’t you be in bed?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“I felt that we were approaching our destination and I wanted to see for myself,
				and besides I was getting a little stir crazy down in sickbay.”
				She chuckled heartedly at the twos expressions of surprise.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Here I thought that Jedi didn’t have any sense of humour,” Commander Hess commented.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Not all Jedi are as stiff as you would think. Master Yoda himself was notorious for playing
				the odd practical joke on his fellow council members,” Aayla responded.
				</p>
                <p>
				As the senior officers conversed with the Jedi the helmsmen networked the ship’s
				navigation system to Shipyard Control to begin the intricate dance that was to bring them into their docking slip,
				followed by the rest of the ships in the battle group. With seemingly agonizing slowness
				the Challenger glided into her slip, helped by various tractor beams and the occasional
				thruster firing to keep her on course. As she glided into position the tractor beams
				held her steady as docking clamps latched onto the hull and the docking slip began to
				close up around the Challenger, sealing her in an airtight open space which soon had breathable air pumped in,
				allowing for biological workers to work without having to don spacesuits to protect themselves
				from the vacuum of space. As soon as it was sealed up and atmosphere was pumped in the crew began to disembark,
				everyone had been ordered off the ship as it underwent its refit,
				except for Chief Engineer Ganto’s engineering teams that were staying aboard to oversee final shutdown procedures.
				</p>
                <p>
				Aayla looked worriedly at Jack, knowing that there were bound to be security cams
				all over the shipyards and it would take only one picture for the Emperors Jedi
				hunters to come in fast and furious for her.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Don’t worry Master Secura. I believe I have an interesting cover for you.
				If you would return to sickbay I think the good doctor has the appropriate attire for you,”
				Jack said grinning, which made Aayla slightly nervous, but knew that for now she would
				have to trust this man, and followed his suggestion.
                </p>
