“Afterwards I felt like I needed to jump into a decontamination shower and burn my uniform, 
along with that accursed medal.”

“That is the same general feeling a Jedi gets when we’re close to someone so steeped 
in the dark side that there is only darkness left in their hearts,” said Aayla from her place at the table.

“You think he was that Sith Lord that was rumoured to be behind the war, it was Palpatine all along?” 
Commander Hess asked.

“I believe so, but belief only gets you so far, and I don’t think any proof we could 
possibly bring to light would even be looked at.”

“Miss, how do you know that’s what a Jedi feels when they are close to a Sith?” Hal asked.

Aayla pulled the veil to the side of her head and bared her face for all to see, 
revealing her identity to everyone in the room.

“I see your taking in strays now, and a most beautiful and dangerous one at that,” Hal commented.

“I found her in her fighter adrift in space, and it was the right thing to do,” said Jack with conviction.

“I knew I raised you right,” said Hal proudly. “It’s just a shame that your mother isn’t here to see...” 
the old man’s face darkened at the memory of his wife’s death, assassinated by Jango Fett 
several years before the Clone Wars, hired by the Hutts to show that he and his family wasn’t safe. 
Hal had commissioned another bounty hunter to kill the hutt that ordered her murder, 
thereby ending the threat to his family and business, but it was still an open wound.

Hal shook his head at the memories and turned to look at his guests.

“Enough of this talk it’s too depressing,” he said as he gestured to the man sitting next to him. 
“I believe you all recognise my partner here, Walex Blissex?”

“Pleasure to meet you,” Blissex said politely. 

“You were the head designer for Rendili StarDrive, weren’t you?” Jack asked. “Why are you here?”
