		“Enemy fighters down to 70%, 65%, they’re dropping like flies sir,” Commander Hess reported.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Mister Blissex I see that my trust in you to make these modifications work wasn’t misplaced,” said the Commodore.
		</p>
        <p>
		“It wasn’t just me, Commodore, it was a team effort,” Blissex responded,
		just before a squadron of fighters came straight for the command bridge.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Incoming,” an ensign shouted as the bridge CIWS guns opened up on the fighters,
		destroying them all only to reveal a squadron of Hyena bombers coming right behind them with missile bays opening.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Close blast doors, now,” Commander Hess ordered just before the Hyenas
		launched their missiles, thick durasteel armour plating with Mandalorian Armour
		reinforcement slammed loudly into place and holographic images of what was happening
		outside were laid over the viewports, showing dummy missiles impacting the shields,
		not even weakening them in the slightest, but the shield rippled like water from the impacts,
		but the Hyenas kept coming.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Enemy bombers have begun making suicide runs,” Commander Hess yelped in surprise
		as a pair of bombers crashed into the side of one of the corvettes,
		hitting with such force that they shoved it off course. The Hyenas attacking the Challenger
		gunned their engines and targeted the command bridge, charging straight through the
		massive barrage of weapons fire that the Challenger’s CIWS put up, downing all
		but two who impacted hard into the shields, weakening the bridge shields significantly.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Don’t tell me you had those droids programmed to do suicide runs on us?” Jack asked his father.
		</p>
        <p>
		“No, I didn’t, I just wanted to test the new CIWS system with a mass fighter attack with fighters,
		bombers and interceptors, nothing like this,” he responded fearfully.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Well we can’t deploy fighters with those droids flying this close to the ship,
		they’d be picked off in seconds,” said the Commodore, fearing that the droids
		would ram his fighters while they launched, plus the particle shields would have to be lowered,
		leaving the launch bay open to attack.
		</p>
        <p>
		He quickly opened a channel to the battle group. “Corvettes move closer to the capital ships,
		but do not get too close, I want you to cover our blind spots while the Challenger,
		Dauntless and Endurance engage the capital ships directly,
		remove those droid fighters from my space,” the Commodore ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		The six corvettes acknowledged and moved closer on the flanks of the three capital ships,
		firing every weapon at their disposal, destroying dozens of droid fighters in seconds,
		but it was like being attacked by a swarm of bees, there were so many of them.
		They soon closed to weapons range to the Lucrehulk and its frigate escort,
		their bow chasers charged up and ready to fire.
