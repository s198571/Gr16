		“Aye sir. Weapons officer, prime the Bow Chasers for firing,” the xo commanded.
		</p>
        <p>
		On the bow of the Challenger, to the sides of the nose doors for the dorsal launch bay,
		two heavily armoured doors opened up, and a pair of beam turbolaser cannons extended forward.
		The gun captains in charge of the weapons tested out the mechanisms that aimed the big guns,
		then they began to charge up, the muzzles of the guns began to glow a bright blue.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Bow Chasers armed and locked on, sir,” the xo reported.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Fire at will Commander, let’s clear our throat,” the Commodore commanded.
		</p>
        <p>
		With a smile the xo ordered, “Fire,” and with a mighty blast both guns discharged at full power.
		The twin beams travelled instantaneously between the Challenger and the planetoid,
		connecting them for a short instant. The beams cut deeply into the asteroid and blew a massive crater.
		From the Dauntless and Endurance similar beams lanced out from their bows,
		deepening the crater and almost knocked the planetoid out of its orbit.
		</p>
        <p>
		“All gunners, fire at will, all turbolasers,” she commanded, and the Challenger
		seemed to light up in a storm of blue weapons fire, sending high energy pulses directly
		into the asteroid, causing it to break up into much smaller pieces.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Not bad,” the Commodore commented.
		</p>
        <p>
		“I told you, you would be pleased,” said Hal as he watched the large asteroid break up
		then asked the xo to tell the shipyard to send out the mining droids.
		</p>
        <p>
		“I have also prepared another test for your ships, in particular the point defence systems.
		I managed to acquire an old CIS Lucrehulk class droid control ship with a full complement of
		droid fighters and bombers, as well as a pair of Munificent class frigates.
		They were originally slated for the scrap yard, but I managed to get them cheap from the Empire,” said Hal,
		looking quite pleased.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Good. Helm set course for the second testing ground, I want to see how our new teeth
		stack up against some real targets,” said the Commodore.
		</p>
        <p>
		The battle group moved away from the asteroid field and headed for open space
		just a few hundred thousand kilometres out, where three old and doomed ships were waiting for their final fate.
		</p>
        <p>
		“I had all three ships disarmed, their fighters as well. The only thing those ships are
		armed with are ordinary targeting lasers. They should pose very little threat to your ships,
		but to make it a little more realistic I also had them crewed by battle droids,
		even got an old tactical on the cheap side,” said Hal.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Good, hopefully that will mean that we’ll get a real challenge instead of just a bunch of
		dumb battle droids with basic programming, those tactical droids may have been among
		the most boring droids you could come across, but during the war the few of them that
		survived long enough to learn, could throw some real curveballs at you,” Commodore Hawks commented.
