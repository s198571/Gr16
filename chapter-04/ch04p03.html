		On the droid control ship a tactical droid, known as TA-22 stood on the bridge,
		overseeing operations. Tactical droids were among the most intelligent series of
		battle droids in the CIS military, commanding entire fleets of ships at various times,
		though their demeanour towards other droids was less than stellar, even sacrificing allies to
		achieve victory, when it wasn’t necessary.
		</p>
        <p>
		This particular tactical droid had managed to survive from the very start of the Clone Wars
		until its deactivation when Lord Vader sent the signal that shut down the entire droid army.
		It also had access to Commodore Hawks’ combat record; it knew its opponent well enough to
		almost precisely calculate how he would attack and react to its own counter attack.
		It also knew that the forces at its disposal, even if they were fully armed,
		had no chance against the Challenger and its battle group; however its orders were clear.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Launch all fighters and arm all weapons, prepare to engage the Challenger battle group,” it ordered.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Roger, roger,” a B1 battle droid responded as it relayed TA-22s orders.
		</p>
        <p>
		Within seconds Vulture droids began falling from racks suspended from the ceiling of the hangars of the
		Lucrehulk and rocketed out, following the commands from central control, their mission,
		to destroy the Challenger battle group by any means necessary. Vulture droids lead the way with
		Hyena bombers coming in right behind them, screened by the vultures. On the flanks were several squadrons of Tri-droids,
		accelerating hard and fast for the corvettes, to draw as much enemy fire as possible without getting shot down.
		These droids were the first to be destroyed.
		</p>
        <p>
		They closed in, launching concussion missiles at the six corvettes,
		but those were quickly destroyed by their CIWS guns, and shortly after the fighters
		themselves got blown out of the sky, tracked by the extremely fast targeting systems.
		Anything that got within range was tracked, targeted then destroyed,
		the barrels of the CIWS guns span like crazy as they spewed out blue streamers
		of plasmatic death into the droid fighters paths. The Corvettes handled most of the fighters,
		but a fair few managed to bypass the them to get to the capital ships,
		launching their own missiles at the Challenger, Dauntless and Endurance,
		only to get shot down by their CIWS guns, placed strategically on the ships.
