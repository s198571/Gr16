                As the Challenger continued through Hyperspace on course for Coruscant Captain Hawks
				was on his way to the ship’s sickbay, Commander Hess had everything well in hand on the bridge.
				He quickly asked for Doctor Magellan and was led straight to him by
				one of the pretty nurses that the good doctor always insisted on having onboard,
				though all of them were all smart and knew their craft well, the captain couldn’t help but wonder
				if he had an ulterior motive.

                “How’s she doing doctor?” Jack asked.
                </p>

                <p>
                “Doing quite well now, if we were any later she would most likely have been dead by the time we got her into the Bacta tank.”
                </p>

                <p>
                “What were her injuries?”
                </p>

                <p>
                “Multiple cuts and bruises, several blaster burns on her back,
                lucky for her none of them hit her spine, otherwise she would most likely have been paralyzed from the waist down.”

                “How is her recovery coming?”
                </p>

                <p>
                “My preliminary analysis leads me to believe she will be in that tank for at least another
				few days to heal her wounds and recovery should only take another day once she’s out of the tank,
				the way Jedi seem to heal.”
                </p>

                <p>
                “Good, let’s just hope that our new emperor doesn’t catch wind of this,
				otherwise all our heads will be up on the chopping block before we’d have the chance to react.”
				Doctor Magellan nodded in agreement.
