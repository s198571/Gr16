				“Sir that’s about the same kind of firepower we would use for taking out a small Separatist base,
				don’t you think it’s a little overkill?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Trust me ‘Commodore,’ in the future you’re going to be glad for the extra ships and firepower
				when you go up against some of the larger pirate bands, some even have managed to get a hold of some
				Separatist warships, including the droids used to both run and defend them.”
				</p>
                <p>
				The sudden look of surprise on the newly promoted Jack Hawks was priceless to the admiral
				who just loved springing these sorts of surprises on the officers under his command.
				</p>
                <p>
				“That’s right Commodore, since you now have command over more than just one ship,
				and the admiralty doesn’t really want to make you an admiral, they decided to just give you an honorary promotion,
				since a Commodore’s duties only extends to the ships he commands and not to other ship captains not in your
				battle group. Attention.”
				</p>
                <p>
				Jack sprang up from his seat and stood at attention as the admiral walked around his desk with a box in his hands.
				Inside was a new insignia to identify him as a Commodore and a unit patch that would
				go on his right upper arm. The admiral removed the old insignia and pinned on the new and replaced the old unit patch.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Thank you sir,” said Jack numbly, trying to process what had just happened.
				</p>
                <p>
				“I also have another surprise for you,” the admiral said smiling.
				“Your new battle group will be the first to receive a full refit and upgrade
				in anticipation of your needs as a new Anti-Piracy Battle Group,
				and you should probably get back to your ship, your ships will arrive within the hour.”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Where are we going for our refits?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Hawks Shipyards in the Corellian system, I believe you are familiar with the place?” the admiral smirked.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Yes sir,” said Jack, smiling at the fond memories he had of the shipyards, the place of his birth.
