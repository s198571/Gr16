		“This looks more like the high end part of Cloud City than a military base,” Kayla commented quietly.
		</p>
        <p>
		“I heard that the admiral had this place commissioned at the beginning of the
		last year of the war and had brought in the same company that built Cloud City
		to design and build it,” said Jack as they walked into a turbolift that took them up
		a few levels, then the protocol droid continued at its brisk pace down another series of corridors,
		until they came to a large set of blast doors that opened as they approached.
		Behind the doors was a large conference room with a big round table with twenty seats surrounding it
		with a large holo-projector in the centre of it.
		</p>
        <p>
		Within the room were several captains and commodores standing around in small groups around the room.
		They all turned to see who the newcomer was and were surprised by the presence of a
		twi’lek in an Imperial uniform, though one that barely followed regulations and had no rank insignia,
		in today’s Imperial Navy there were almost no aliens except for a privileged few.
		</p>
        <p>
		A young blonde female lieutenant came in from a side door. She then walked over to the
		round table and banged with a small gavel, bringing everyone to the table.
		“This meeting is classified, gentlemen, Admiral Carth Rod.”
		From the same door came the admiral in his normal dark grey day uniform with full insignia.
		</p>
        <p>
		“At ease people, please take your seats,” the admiral gestured to everyone in the room,
		everyone quickly taking their appointed seat. Commodore Hawks quickly found his seat
		just two chairs away from the admiral, with Kayla standing just a couple of feet behind
		and to the right of his chair with a notepad in her hands, her eyes taking in everything within the conference room.

		“People the empire is now facing a real threat right now, a threat that has been
		growing even greater in the past year since the end of the Clone Wars,
		there has been a steady increase in pirate attacks on colonies, outposts and civilian convoys
		in the Mid- and Outer Rim-Territories,” said the admiral. “The Emperor has given me the duty
		of removing this threat, to that end I have decided to form several independent battle groups
		that will be on a constant roaming patrol across the Outer Rim, to engage and destroy these pirates.
		We will also be working alongside Imperial Intelligence who will be providing
		up-to-date intelligence on each pirate gang and organisation.”
		</p>
        <p>
		“Admiral, why can’t Intelligence just give the info to Fleet Command and they send a
		Star Destroyer to clear the pirates out?” a younger commodore with a pleasant face,
		but with an arrogant attitude asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Because a single large warship isn’t a proper response, Commodore Delmar” the admiral
		responded calmly, but with a slight measure of annoyance at the younger officer’s attitude.
		“Yes a Star Destroyer has the fire power and the troops to take a planet,
		but according to recent intelligence various pirate outfits have managed to get a hold of
		a lot of Separatist war materials, everything from B1 battle droids to
		fully fledged Lucrehulk class battleships,” continued the admiral.
		Many of the veterans, including Commodore Hawks, remembered how tough those ships
		were to take down, often requiring entire flotillas of star destroyers to take just one of them down.
