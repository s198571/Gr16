		“How was the brandy?” the admiral asked smiling.

        <p>
		Jack responded a little hoarsely, “Strong sir, very strong.”

        <p>
		“Well, I’d better let you get on with your duties, you’ve got a battle group to run and you also have some old friends to reacquaint yourself with.”

		“Aye sir,” said Jack as he gingerly rose up from his chair and saluted, Kayla followed his lead and saluted as well then walked out of the admiral’s office. The two of them pointedly ignored the curious and jealous looks of the various commodores that were waiting for their turn with the admiral as they passed the station’s bar. One commodore in particular was eying Kayla with a leering eye, which gave Kayla a very bad feeling through the Force.

		“Sir, I’ve got a really sick feeling about Commodore Delmar, his mind is dark and twisted,” she whispered quietly as they continued along.

        <p>
		“I see I’m not the only one who’s got a bad feeling about him,” said Jack. He could almost feel the man’s jealousy as a bad smell. As they were about to continue on to the docks, Jack spotted an old friend. “Stay close to me,” he ordered as he headed towards the bar and walked up beside an older officer with dark skin and a small number of grey hairs were showing through his dark hair.

		“Hello Jack, long time no see,” the officer said smiling as he looked in the mirror behind the bar to see who was behind him, then tossed back his small glass of liquor. “Ten long years since you sat in my classroom as a fresh-faced cadet, mind introducing me to your friend?”

        <p>
		“Of course, this is Kayla Macula, my personal aide, Kayla this is Commodore Baran Tisztelet, one of my old teachers at the academy, he was the one who taught me starship combat tactics and strategy.”

        <p>
		“You certainly put it to good use when the navy gave you the Challenger, while I’m stuck on the Concordia,” said Commodore Tisztelet bitterly. “I was supposed to be getting one of the Challenger’s sister-ships, but of course in the Chancellor’s, oh excuse me, Emperor Palpatine’s opinion the improved Venator class was a waste of resources,” he said, barely covered his little slip. “Even though it corrected a number of design flaws in the previous incarnation, now the Empire is building those Sith cursed Imperial class Star Destroyers, and I’ll be more than likely forced to retire when they decommission the Concordia.”

        <p>
		“And well you should,” piped up the younger Commodore Delmar who was sitting at a circular table with four of his ship captains who were playing a game of sabacc, the good commodore having won a fair share of hands by the look of the rather large pile of Imperial credit ingots, as well as the sour looks on the captains faces. “You’re ships are now just a relic of a bygone era, my Triumph is far superior to your Concordia, and the Challenger, they should both be hauled away as garbage and sold for scrap,” he said loudly and much to the two Commodore’s consternation the captains laughed with their captain. “Waiter, another round for me and my friends here,” he called out to a waitress who had just delivered a round of drinks to another group.
