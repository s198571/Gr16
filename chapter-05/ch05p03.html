		“Another one of your father’s original modifications,” Kayla asked.
		</p>
        <p>
		“Yes, my father always enjoyed having these shuttles decked out with various luxuries.
		Sometimes I think he believes that someday there’ll be a show on the Holonet about ship customization,” said Jack.

		The two got comfortable and seconds later the shuttle was speeding out of the
		Challenger’s main launch bay, with a pair of Republic Z-95 Headhunters from the
		Challenger as escort following close by on its flanks.

        <p>
		“I see a lot of ships out there,” commented Kayla as she looked out through the
		projected holographic windows that lined the sides of the shuttle’s passenger compartment.

        <p>
		“Yes, the admiral has managed to call together a large number of ships for this
		Anti-Piracy Fleet he has been working to build up. Most of them are Clone Wars veterans,
		but I’ve heard that a few are newer, greener commanders with little command experience,
		and one or two Imperial stooges that just see this as another bump up the ladder of their careers.”

		The shuttle and its escorts continued through the vast throng of ships,
		the pilots followed the provided flight plan from the local Imperial Starbase.
		The shuttle dipped into the atmosphere of Bespin and quickly descended into the life zone,
		where the clouds were coloured a dark iron red from the rising sun. As the shuttle cleared a
		large formation of clouds the Imperial base came into view. It was a long fifteen kilometre
		high core cylinder with a large oval disk section at the top over ten kilometres across.
		As they came closer they could see that unlike Cloud City, which had a large cityscape in
		the centre at the top, there was a single tall tower, the Air Traffic Control centre for the base,
		and below the disk were several cluster of ion plasma rocket engines, the same type used on
		Imperial Star Destroyers, obviously built to be mobile, Jack noted.

        <p>
		They were quickly directed to land in one of the topmost landing bays,
		their escort was directed to another landing bay for fighters. The shuttle glided
		gently through the doors to the bay and was further directed by a set of internal
		guidance beams to their designated landing area, landing almost completely on automatic,
		the pilots handled the final landing and extended the landing gear.
		With a slight thump the shuttle was down, the landing gear taking the full weight of the shuttle.

        <p>
		The boarding ramp lowered and Jack and Kayla exited, with her being two or three steps behind the Commodore,
		a respectful distance for an aide. A silver protocol droid approached the shuttle.
		</p>
        <p>
		“I am TC-147 at you service, the admiral is expecting you, follow me please” said the droid
		in its female programmed voice. It led them out of the hangar bay and into the corridors.
		The interior was somewhat different than on standard Imperial bases,
		instead of the usual durasteel grey the walls were painted white and had
		intricate designs that looked to be etched into the metal walls, with the occasional plant or
		tasteful artwork to break up the monotony.
