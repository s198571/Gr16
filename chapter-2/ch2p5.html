				“The Jedi had to rebuild from almost the foundations, and just as before they became too focused
				upon their own bloody code that they became blind to what was happening right under their noses.
				The cycle of death and rebirth repeats itself,” now the Admiral sounded annoyed.
				</p>
                <p>
				“How do you know of this, if I may ask sir?”
				</p>
                <p>
				The admiral gave a small smile. “Let’s just say my family has a history with the Jedi and we’ll leave it at that!”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Yes sir.”
				</p>
                <p>
				“I bet your wondering why I called you here,” he said as he noticed the look of curiosity in the Captain’s eyes.
				“I ordered you here to tell you that I have transferred your ship and crew over to my command,
				you will be part of a new task force that I and several other admirals proposed.
				You are going to take command of a new Anti-Piracy Battle Group, one of several that are planned
				in the coming years. Your job will be to hunt down and destroy any pirates that prey upon Imperial shipping,
				particularly in the Core Worlds like Corellia.”
				</p>
                <p>
				This was a surprise, anti-piracy was one of the reasons Jack had joined the Corellian Defence Forces.

                <p>
				“The Challenger will still be your flagship; however you will not be alone.
				I am also assigning two Acclamator II class frigates to your battle group,
				the Endurance and the Dauntless, both captained by old friends of yours I believe,” said the Admiral plainly.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Yes, Captains Victor Macdougan and Zack Richter, they were both in my squadron when I was a fighter pilot.
				Sir why isn’t Captain MacDougal getting this command, he’s senior?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“Because you have the most powerful ship and the most experience in dealing with pirates,
				the other two are fine captains, but they don’t know how the mind of a pirate works. You do!”
				</p>
                <p>
				"Very well,” Jack said resigned. “What other ships am I getting; I’m assuming it won’t just be capital ships?”
				</p>
                <p>
				“You’ll also be getting six military CR90 Corvettes. That should be more than enough firepower to take down
				any known pirate band out there.” The Admiral looked rather smug.
