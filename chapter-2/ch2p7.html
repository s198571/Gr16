				An hour later the eight ships that Commodore Jack Hawks had received command of
				arrived in orbit of Coruscant and as soon as they had achieved parking orbit
				the newly promoted Commodore requested the commanding officers of all ships to
				come aboard the Challenger for a staff meeting.
				</p>
                <p>
				They met in the Captains Mess and all took their seats, with Jack at the head of the table.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Alright people, now that we’re all here I guess you’ve all received your new orders and
				know that you have all had yourselves and your commands transferred under me.
				I am also confident that you have seen what has happened to the Republic and the Jedi Order.
				One twisted and forged into an Empire, the other for all intents and purposes destroyed, opinions gentlemen?”
				</p>
                <p>
				Every one of the captains assembled looked nervously at each other and at their new commanding officer.
				The Commodore gave them a challenging stare-down, daring them to speak up.
				At last one of the captains, the oldest, Captain Macdougan finally worked up the courage and said,
				“It is a damned disgrace, and it makes me sick to think that with one order one man
				wiped out the entire Jedi Order, right down to the last youngling,
				and now we are being ordered to hunt down and kill them.
				The Jedi I worked with, before and during the war, had no aspirations to take over,
				just to serve and protect the people; they were peacekeepers for crying out loud.”
				</p>
                <p>
				Every captain in the room nodded in agreement and the Commodore smiled and nodded at his old friend.
				</p>
                <p>
				“Thank you my old friend for voicing everyone’s opinion at this table,
				and I bet you all want to take your ships and bomb the Emperor’s palace
				until there is nothing more than a smoking crater!”
				The idea appealed greatly to them all, but there is always a problem.
				“The only problem is that we’d be shot down before we’d even be able to fire a second shot.”
				</p>
                <p>
				“It would be worth it just to remove him,” said one of the younger commanders.
				</p>
                <p>
				“What about the lives of your crew, did you think of them?” Jack retorted.
				</p>
                <p>
				Everyone grew quiet at that. They were all loyal to their crews and would never needlessly endanger them.
				</p>
                <p>
				“For now we and a small number of people we know within the military are the only ones that
				share the same opinion about Order 66. We all know the role we have been set to play in this new order.
				To hunt down pirates and other organized crime within the new Empire, and for now that’s what we will do.”
				The looks on his Captains faces were ones of disappointment then interest.
				“We will keep a generally low profile and talk the party line, but in the process
				we’ll be getting whole new ships. The Imperial Fleet is footing the bill for a series of refits
				and upgrades for our ships to be done at the Shipyards in the Corellian system, the Hawks shipyards to be specific.”
